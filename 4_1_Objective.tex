%This entire chapter should focus on what has been done. 
Regarding the latest research focusing on addressing the two-step simplification of occupants into environmental parameters, we can categorize them based on their means of planned intervention and its relationship to the occupants into objective and subjective. For the objective interventions, occupants' physiological responses are directly measured through different sensing techniques, and calibrated by the actual votes of the occupants. 

\subsubsection{Direct physiological parameters from wearable sensors}
Measuring the physiological response of the human body has been historically challenging. 

Among other measurable responses, the skin temperature of the human body is more common in existing research. To accurately measure the physiological responses of the human body, traditional sensing techniques are often intrusive: sensors that needs to be strapped onto the body \cite{mccarthy_validation_2016}, or needing to be ingested (e.g. core-temperature-measuring radio pill \cite{}) effectively make it impossible to measure real-time responses for multiple multiples in a real office environment. 

Development in sensing technology has helped researchers to come up with solutions to the comfort conundrum. 

Studies on how sensitive different locations of the human skin are sensitive to changes of the thermal environment have pointed to a few specific locations including the wrist temperature, which later became a major research concentration for researchers\cite{choi_cobi:_2010}.
