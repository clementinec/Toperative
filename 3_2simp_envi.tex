\subsubsection{Mean Radiant Temperature}
            Problems in under MRT as a concept: difficulty to interpret Iterations attempting to simplify MRT: ISO, surface averaged, etc. Causes problems in measuring MRTs.
\subsubsection{One MRT in one room}
            Measurement protocols of MRT and IEQ (check PoE protocols). 
            Simulation methods when obtaining MRT
\subsubsection{Air == MRT}
            Cases where this assumption might be true.
            Scenarios where Air â‰  MRT needs to be better recognized:
            Radiant systems
            Shortwave radiation through huge fenestration systems
            Larger view-factors of adjacent cold/hot surface areas: ocean/river
\subsubsection{Simplified RH}
            Maybe briefly mention how we are suggesting we have already kept HR in check?
            Complexity in creating two-objective systems? Price?
\subsection{Other sensed data}
    A good(?) question is whether we want to keep the structure of the paper - or add more stuffs. There's the performance gap hat should go in somewhere, and problem of the two-stage simplification is that it's not super clear yet. How do you simplify a group into a person, that part is not clear enough. Or is it? In 3-1 and 3-2?
