With respect to how the thermal comfort can be characterized within a thermal environment, the existing literature often uses indoor/outdoor to categorize them(Rupp, 2015). This is a valid classification method when considering the environments to be either built (indoor) or natural (outdoor), which is also a natural result of the indoor and outdoor research communities being independent of each other: the indoor community focuses on ensuring the built environment satisfiable, following often either the ISO 7730 \cite{iso_iso_2005} or the ASHRAE Standard 55 \cite{ansi/ashrae_standard_2017} while the outdoor community deals with a wider range of environmental parameters and are often more concentrated on heat stresses ISO 7243 (7243, 2017). When it comes to the actual method of evaluation, we believe we can also categorize these thermal comfort metrics into whether they're directly measurable or not. Understanding whether resulting indices are directly linked to 

\subsubsection{Non-measurable metrics}
    A significant portion of the metrics used in the outdoor environment when assessing thermal comfort are not directly measurable
    %NOTE: THIS IS BEYOND OCCUPANT EVEN, as there's NO WAY to validate the simulated results other than their comparative differences, emphasize on how many different variables are involved during this process. 
    Among these variables, the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) are becoming increasingly popular.
    \paragraph{PET} is first proposed by Hoppe who pointed out the necessity of a universal index describing the well-being of the occupant for both the indoor and outdoor environment. 
    
    benefits and caveats of PET
    

    The physiological equivalent temperature (PET) was proposed by Hoppe\cite{h._hoppe_new_1992}   
    \paragraph{UTCI}, or universal thermal climate index is a concept specifically developed by urban climatologists to address the challenges posed by the ongoing/upcoming challenges observed in the urban environment.
    %How it was first proposed
    
    Its application among the existing studies primarily sits within the urban climate studies and simulations.
    
    It's important to point out that all these metrics are non-measurable and unverifiable on their own. Unlike vote-like systems such as PMV that the results can directly be compared with the actual mean vote among the occupants, these variables cannot be compared with directly measured values without making assumptions about what is the best proxy of comfort. 
    Attempts to verify the simulated results often ends up  
    A common trait between these variables is that none of them can be actually measured or calibrated. 
\subsubsection{Measurable metrics}
        %W/m2
        W/m2
        $W/m^2$ is the surface-area-averaged incoming radiation at any given time. It can be directly measured by radiant flux sensors - often a thermopile (Jones, 1985). Thermopiles are capable of generating various votltages, thus by measuring the voltage differences generated between overall incoming radiant flux and the surrounding environment, and can therefore be used to measure the radiant flux within measured field of view.
