	abstract = {The use of accurate and fine-grained occupancy information in building operation can, in addition to providing visualization of space use, provide worthwhile energy savings when the operation of lighting, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems are tailored to actual building occupancy information. Although there are ample off-the-shelf heterogeneous occupancy sensors available for use in practice, the information provided is often coarse-grained and inaccurate. As a result, multiple sensors, which cost more to install and maintain are often used in building operation for occupancy driven control of lighting, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems (L-{HVAC}). This article presents results from the experimental evaluation of chair sensors using sensing techniques based on strain, vibration and a mechanical-switch for occupancy detection in an office space. In addition, results from the application of one of the chair sensors in an open-plan office space as a heterogeneous occupancy detection system for occupancy-driven control of the lighting system in the space is as well provided.},

	abstract = {Several techniques have been proposed for the automatic control of just-in-time heating and cooling systems in indoor spaces that accommodate both the occupants' comfort and energy savings. Current techniques, however, do not provide an adequate solution for efficient thermostat control, because they require costly infrastructures to detect occupancy or because they inaccurately predict the occupancy due to irregular patterns. In this paper, we propose an automatic thermostat control system based on the mobility prediction of users, using contextual information obtained by mobile phones. We also present an arrival time prediction scheme that combines both historical pattern and route classification. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system can successfully predict at least 70\% of the transit cases within 10 minutes' error and can decrease energy consumption by 26\%.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in information and communication technology have sparked the notion of smart buildings; an example of which is occupant-centric control ({OCC}). In this approach, a control system acquires various data from occupants, the indoor environment, and outdoor climate, and learns or derives useful information for building control, e.g., room occupancy patterns and adaptive set-points. Ultimately, these adaptive control parameters are used to improve both occupant comfort and energy efficiency. Typical {OCC} approaches have been put forward in concept papers, small-scale experiments, as well as simulations. However, there are relatively few studies in which {OCC} is implemented in real buildings. In this article, we review {OCC} research, focusing on field-implementation case studies in actual buildings under realistic use conditions. First, we analyze the topical aspects of these studies, e.g., building types, location, and building systems. Next, we present a methodological review focusing on the different approaches used to implement {OCC} in existing building systems. Lastly, we investigate the experimental design approach of the reviewed case studies, focusing on measurement and verification techniques. Results highlight wide discrepancies in the implementation approach of {OCC} case studies and identify common challenges facing {OCC} in actual buildings. We propose future directions for {OCC} research by providing recommendations to address these challenges and to standardize {OCC} implementations.},

	abstract = {Occupancy sensors have long been used for control of various devices (like artificial light, {HVAC} devices, etc.). Past research has shown that use of occupancy sensors for control of lighting can save up to 30\% electrical energy used for lighting. However, most of the sensors, which are currently being put to use, have a preset (sometimes user adjustable) time delay ({TD}) (the time after which the lights or any other load will be switched “off” after the last motion is detected by the sensor). If this {TD} is long then, it will have less energy savings, as the load will remain “on” during unoccupied period also. At the same time, if the {TD} is kept short then it may result in unwanted switching “off” (False Off) of the lights when no motion is detected during periods of occupancy. It has been observed in our research that the activity level of a user changes over the time of the day. Also, it is seen that activity level of different users is different. Hence, single {TD} for all the users and for all times of the day is not desirable. The commonly used sensors do not adapt to changing activity levels. In this paper, we present design of smart occupancy sensors which can adapt to changing activity levels. A model is also proposed for “human movement” of a person working at a computer. Smart occupancy sensor can learn the variation in activity level of the occupants with respect to time of the day. With this information, it can change the {TD} with time of the day. Experiments conducted have shown that about 5\% more energy can be saved by using smart occupancy sensor as compared to non-adapting fixed {TD} sensors.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the application of sensor networks to lighting control, and had two goals. The first goal was to evaluate the utility of using more than one sensor to detect occupancy. Sensor networks were installed in a sample of private offices and cubicle workstations. Large individual differences in sensor response to occupancy were observed in all monitored areas: the percent difference in occupied time measured by sensors in ten private offices ranged from 16.1 percent to 74.0 percent (mean 44.7 percent): the differences between detectors measuring occupancy in 23 cubicle workstations ranged from 14 percent to 91 percent (mean 53.7 percent). These data establish the considerable uncertainty in occupancy measurement that exists with current systems. Current control systems compensate for this uncertainty by applying a long time delay before switching lights off. Since a sensor network more accurately measures occupancy, shorter time delays can be applied to reduce system operating time and save energy. Applying a 5-minute time delay to sensor network data, instead of the 20 minutes that is more typical in current single sensor applications, reduced operating time by an additional 22.4 percent to 33.3 percent (relative to the reductions that would have resulted from use of a single sensor). A longer time delay of 10 minutes applied to the sensor network data stream produced reductions of 8.4 percent to 24.7 percent, relative to the reduction that would have resulted from use of a single sensor with a 20-minute time delay.},

This paper presents the implementation of the controller and the measured performance in comparison with the default, rule-based control ({RBC}).

The practical situation does not allow controlling end-units in the different zones of the building. The {MPC} makes use of a Modelica grey-box control model resulting from a system identification with monitoring data. The paper covers the monitoring, model identification, forecasting of disturbances, state estimation, formulation and solving of the optimal control problem ({OCP}) and transmission of the control signals. The performance is evaluated on a daily basis based on analysis of heating degree days, thermal comfort, energy costs and primary energy consumption. The results show that the model predictive controller is able to provide a similar or better thermal comfort than the reference control while reducing the energy costs by more than 30\%. This is due among others, to a better use of the heat pumps and an adapted hot water supply temperature.},

	abstract = {Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning ({HVAC}) are among the major energy demand in the buildings sector globally. Improving the energy efficiency of such systems is a critical objective for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning towards renewable sources of energy supply. The interest of this paper is to explore means to increase the efficiency of {HVAC} systems in accommodating occupants’ behavior in real time. For instance, rooms in office buildings are not always occupied by occupants during scheduled {HVAC} service periods. This offers an opportunity to reduce unnecessary energy demands of {HVAC} systems associated with occupants’ behavior. An in-depth analysis of occupants’ stochastic behavior within an office building is conducted in this paper. A demand-driven control strategy is proposed that automatically responds to occupants’ energy-related behavior for reducing energy consumption and maintains room temperature for occupants with similar performances as a static cooling. In this control strategy, two types of machine learning methods – unsupervised and supervised learning – are applied to learn occupants’ behavior in two learning processes. The occupancy-related information learned by the algorithms is used by a set of specified rules to infer real-time room setpoints for controlling the office's space cooling system. This learning-based approach intends to reduce the need for human intervention in the cooling system’s control. The proposed strategy was applied to control the cooling system of the office building under real-world conditions. Eleven case study office spaces were selected, representing three typical office uses: single person offices, multi-person offices, and meeting rooms. The experimental results report between 7\% and 52\% energy savings as compared to the conventionally-scheduled cooling systems.},

	abstract = {Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning ({HVAC}) are vital components in providing a comfortable indoor climate for the occupants of buildings. In commercial buildings, {HVAC} setpoints are set according to average comfort temperatures. However, individual temperature preferences may be different. The purpose of this study is to explore the means of making {HVAC} systems respond automatically to local occupant temperature preferences. To create an occupant-centric indoor temperature environment, we propose an online-learning-based control strategy together with its design process. Four essential variables from four domains—time, indoor and outdoor climates, and occupant behavior—are extracted to construct datasets for preference models. A neural network algorithm and corresponding hyperparameters are suggested to model temperature preferences. According to time-dependent setpoints learned from dynamic contexts, a set of specified rules is used to determine setpoints for {HVAC} systems. For a period of five months, the resulting learning-based temperature preference control ({LTPC}) was applied to a cooling system of an office space under real-world conditions. The four case study rooms consisted of typical office uses: single-person and multi-person offices. The experimental results indicate that occupant preferences in the individual rooms differ from each other in both time horizon and temperature levels. The results report energy savings of between 4\% and 25\% as compared to static temperature setpoints at the low values of preferred temperature ranges. Meanwhile, during {LPTC}, the need for occupant interventions for adjusting room temperatures to fit their preferences was reduced from four to nine weekdays a month to a maximum of one weekday a month.},

We compared {PreHeat}'s prediction algorithm with a static program over an average 61 days per house, alternating days between these conditions, and measuring actual gas consumption and occupancy. In {UK} homes {PreHeat} both saved gas and reduced {MissTime} (the time that the house was occupied but not warm). In {US} homes, {PreHeat} decreased {MissTime} by a factor of 6-12, while consuming a similar amount of gas.

We have designed a mobile application that occupants can use on their smart phones to provide their thermal preference feedback. When relaying the occupant feedback to the central server the mobile application also uses indoor location techniques to tie the occupant preference to their current thermal zone. Texas Instruments sensortags are used for real time zonal temperature readings. The mobile application relays the occupant preference along with the location to a central server that also hosts our learning algorithm to learn the environment and using occupant feedback calculates the optimal temperature set point. The entire process is triggered upon change of occupancy, environmental conditions, and/or occupant preference. The learning algorithm is scheduled to run at regular intervals to respond dynamically to environmental and occupancy changes. We describe results from experimental studies in two different settings: a single family residential home setting and in a university based laboratory space setting.},

This large contribution calls for the creation of energy-efficient lighting control schemes. In this article, we present {WinLight}, a novel occupancy-driven lighting control system that aims to reduce energy consumption while simultaneously preserving the lighting comfort of occupants. By leveraging the fine-grained occupancy information estimated by existing {WiFi} infrastructure in a non-intrusive manner, {WinLight} computes an appropriate dimming command for each lamp based on a novel lighting control algorithm. A centralized lighting control system assigns these commands to a zonal gateway, and occupancy-driven lighting control is achieved by actuating the brightness adjustment with a local controller integrated within each lamp. Moreover, a {WinLight} App is designed to enable occupants to customize their luminance preferences and to control nearby lamps using their mobile devices. We implemented {WinLight} in a 1500m2 multi-functional office in Singapore and conducted an experiment during 24 weeks. The experimental results demonstrate that {WinLight} achieves 93.09\% and 80.27\% energy savings compared to static scheduling lighting control scheme and {PIR} sensor based lighting control scheme while guaranteeing the personalized lighting comfort of each occupant.},

The core purpose of this solar-assisted air-conditioning system is to handle the cooling and heating load of the Solar Energy Research Centre ({CIESOL}), thus minimising its environmental impact. In this study, the cooling mode was investigated with special attention focused on the chilled-water storage circuit. The critical concern is that the solar-assisted air-conditioning system should always operate considering the actual load conditions, not using an abstract maximum load that is predetermined during the system’s design process, which can lead to energy waste during periods of low occupancy. Thus, the fundamental problem is to identify the optimum operation sequence for the solar-assisted air-conditioning system that provides the best energy performance. The significance of this work lies in the demonstration of a new operation strategy that utilises real-time occupancy monitoring and chilled-water storage tanks to improve the efficiency of solar-assisted air-conditioning systems, thereby reducing their electricity consumption. Adopting this strategy resulted in a large energy-saving potential. The results demonstrate that during one cooling period, it is possible to conserve approximately 42\% of the total electrical energy consumed by the system prior to the adoption of this operation strategy.},

In contrast to prior work that reports energy savings without a careful measure of the effect on indoor climate, we verify that the controller achieves the energy efficiency improvements without any adverse effect on the indoor climate compared to the building's baseline controller. This is established from measurements of a host of environmental variables and analysis of before-after occupant survey results. We present a complete system to retrofit existing buildings including the control algorithm and the supporting execution platform which includes the deployment of a wireless sensor network. Results show that there is a large variation in energy savings from zone to zone, which indicates that estimating energy savings potential of novel {HVAC} control systems is not trivial even from experiments-something that prior work with uniformly positive messages did not emphasize.},

The authors observed that the occupants interact with their thermostats infrequently (on average once every 56 h of occupancy); and when they did so, occupants changed the temperature set-point, on average, by 1°C. The authors observed that about one-third of the thermostat overrides were either to decrease the set-points during the heating season, or to increase the set-points during the cooling season. The temperatures leading to the thermostat overrides changed by ∼3°C seasonally. It was noted that the frequency of thermostat interactions can be approximated as a univariate logistic regression model that inputs the indoor temperature as the predictor variable. A recursive algorithm was formulated to develop univariate thermostat use models inside building controllers. It was implemented inside four commercial controllers serving seven private office spaces to choose operating set-points. One year after the implementation, the iterative learning process resulted in a 2°C–3°C reduction in the set-points during the heating season and a 2°C–3°C increase in the set-points during the cooling season with respect to the default 22°C set-point in both seasons.},

The application of occupant-driven demand control measures in buildings, most especially in the control of thermal, visual and indoor air quality providing systems, which account for over 30\% of the energy consumed in a typical office building is however hampered due to the lack of comprehensive fine-grained occupancy information. Given that comprehensive fine-grained occupancy information improves the performance of demand-driven measures, this paper presents a review of common existing systems utilized in buildings for occupancy detection. Furthermore, experimental results from the performance evaluation of chair sensors in an office building for providing fine-grained occupancy information for demand-driven control applications are presented.},

	abstract = {In commercial buildings, lighting contributes to about 20\% of the total energy consumption. Lighting controllers that integrate occupancy and luminosity sensors to improve energy efficiency have been proposed. However, they are often ineffective because they focus solely on energy consumption rather than providing comfort to the occupants. An ideal controller should adapt itself to the preferences of the occupant and the environmental conditions. In this article, we introduce {LightLearn}, an occupant centered controller ({OCC}) for lighting based on Reinforcement Learning ({RL}). We describe the theory and hardware implementation of {LightLearn}. Our experiment during eight weeks in five offices shows that {LightLearn} learns the individual occupant behaviors and indoor environmental conditions, and adapts its control parameters accordingly by determining personalized set-points. Participants reported that the overall lighting was slightly improved compared to prior lighting conditions. We compare {LightLearn} to schedule-based and occupancy-based control scenarios, and evaluate their performance with respect to total energy use, light-utilization-ratio, unmet comfort hours, as well as light-comfort-ratio, which we introduce in this paper. We show that only {LightLearn} balances successfully occupant comfort and energy consumption. The adaptive nature of {LightLearn} suggests that reinforcement learning based occupant centered control is a viable approach to mitigate the discrepancy between occupant comfort and the goals of building control.},

Upon this analysis, an adaptive lighting and blinds control algorithm was formulated. The algorithm learns occupants' illuminance preferences from their light switch-on and blinds closing behaviours, and employs this information to determine the photosensor setpoints to switch off lighting and to open blinds. The algorithm was implemented inside controllers serving five private offices and a controls laboratory – a shared office space with a standalone controls network. Alternative control scenarios were analyzed through integrated daylighting and occupant behaviour simulations. The results indicate that the use of an adaptive lighting and blinds control algorithm developed in this paper can substantially reduce the lighting loads in office buildings – without adversely affecting the occupant comfort.},

	abstract = {Personal Comfort Systems ({PCS}) provide individual occupants local heating and cooling to meet their comfort needs without affecting others in the same space. It saves energy by relaxing ambient temperature requirements for the {HVAC} system. Aside from these benefits, {PCS} offers a wealth of data that can describe how individuals interact with heating/cooling devices in their own environment. Recently developed Internet-connected {PCS} chairs have unlocked this opportunity by generating continuous streams of heating and cooling usage data, along with occupancy status and environmental measurements via embedded sensors. The data allow individuals' comfort and behavior to be learned, and can inform centralized systems to provide ‘just the right’ amount of conditioning to meet occupant needs. In summer 2016, we carried out a study with {PCS} chairs involving 37 occupants in an office building in California. During the study period, we collected {\textgreater}5 million chair usage data-points and 4500 occupant survey responses, as well as continuous measurements of environmental and {HVAC} system conditions. The data analysis shows that (1) local temperatures experienced by individual occupants vary quite widely across different parts of the building, even within the same thermal zone; (2) occupants often have different thermal preferences even under the same thermal conditions; (3) {PCS} control behavior can dynamically describe individuals' thermal preferences; (4) {PCS} chairs produce much higher comfort satisfaction (96\%) than typically achieved in buildings. We conclude that {PCS} not only provide personalized comfort solutions but also offer individualized feedback that can improve comfort analytics and control decisions in buildings.},

Of this total, 50\% of the energy consumed in buildings is used for Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning ({HVAC}) systems. Current {HVAC} systems only condition based on static schedules; rooms are conditioned regardless of occupancy. By conditioning rooms only when necessary, greater efficiency can be achieved. This paper describes {POEM}, a complete closed-loop system for optimally controlling {HVAC} systems in buildings based on actual occupancy levels. {POEM} is comprised of multiple parts. A wireless network of cameras called {OPTNet} is developed that functions as an optical turnstile to measure area/zone occupancies. Another wireless sensor network of passive infrared ({PIR}) sensors called {BONet} functions alongside {OPTNet}. This sensed occupancy data from both systems are then fused with an occupancy prediction model using a particle filter in order to determine the most accurate current occupancy in each zone in the building. Finally, the information from occupancy prediction models and current occupancy is combined in order to find the optimal conditioning strategy required to reach target temperatures and minimize ventilation requirements. Based on live tests of the system, we estimate {\textasciitilde}30.0\% energy saving can be achieved while still maintaining thermal comfort.},

Lack of information about human related variables results in using unrepresentative operational settings, which in turn could bring about low efficiency in {HVAC} operations. In this paper, the implementation and evaluation of a framework that integrates building occupants’ personalized thermal profiles into the {HVAC} control logic is presented. The framework enables occupants to communicate their preferences for indoor thermal conditions through a user interface, leveraging a participatory sensing approach. The framework learns occupants’ comfort profiles, using a fuzzy predictive model, and controls the {HVAC} system using a complementary control strategy, which enables the framework to be implemented in existing centrally controlled {HVAC} systems with minimum intrusion. Evaluation of the framework in a real building setting showed user comfort improvement. Moreover, the results showed a 39\% reduction in daily average airflow when the {HVAC} system conditions the rooms at occupants’ desired temperatures. Airflow is proportional to the energy consumption of {HVAC} system components. Consequently, the implementation of the framework shows improvements in the efficiency of the {HVAC} system's performance for centrally controlled office buildings.},

As far as the lighting services are concerned, control systems offer an important opportunity of managing lighting systems and reducing energy consumption, due to the use of integration strategies between daylight and electric lighting and strategies based on the occupancy of spaces. The results of an experimental case study of ten offices in Torino (Italy), in which a custom-design building automation and control system has been designed to control both the lighting plants and the air conditioning system, are presented in this paper. The study was carried out in order to evaluate the energy efficiency of the lighting control system and to analyse the environmental luminous conditions obtained through the application of this technology to a real case. The environmental and energy performances, together with the degree of users' satisfaction and acceptance of this control system, were analysed after a year of activity to verify the potentiality and operation of this lighting control system. The obtained results regarding the potential energy savings (from 17\% to 32\%) were evaluated taking into account both the monitored annual electric energy consumption (for operation) and the parasitic energy consumption due to the installed devices (luminaire ballasts, sensors and controllers), and were compared with the estimated energy consumption calculated applying the method proposed in the European standard {EN} 15193:2007.},

In order to reduce lighting energy use, the luminaires employed integral occupancy sensors and light sensors (daylight harvesting), as well as individual dimming control accessed through occupants' computer screens. Data were collected from 86 workstations over a year to examine the energy savings and power reduction attributable to the controls, and how the controls were used. An awareness campaign that used e-mail reminders to encourage the occupants to use the individual control feature of the lighting system was also conducted. Results indicate that the lighting system generated substantial energy savings and peak power reductions compared to a conventional fluorescent lighting system installed on a neighboring floor. The installed lighting power was 42 percent lower than that of the conventional system. The three controls combined saved 42 to 47 percent in lighting energy use compared to the same lights used at full power during work-hours; this translated into overall savings of 67 to 69 percent compared to the conventional lighting system. If the three lighting controls systems had been installed separately, occupancy sensors would have saved, on average, 35 percent if used alone, light sensors (daylight harvesting) 20 percent, and individual dimming 11 percent. The light sensor savings were, as expected, higher in perimeter workstations, and would have matched the performance of the occupancy sensors with some modifications to the control parameters. The average daily peak power demand for lighting was also reduced by a similar amount, which resulted in an average effective lighting power density of only 3 W/m2. Although not detailed in this paper, surveys indicated that the studied lighting system was also associated with higher occupant satisfaction. This was likely due to the individual dimming control, although use of this control beyond an initial preferred setting was rare.},

This article presents results from the experimental evaluation of chair sensors using sensing techniques based on strain, vibration and a mechanical-switch for occupancy detection in an office space.

However, a large performance gap may not necessarily mean that there are flaws in the building or deviations from the intended design. The causes for the performance gap can be analysed by calibrating the simulation model to measured data. In this paper, an approach is introduced for verifying compliance with energy performance criteria of residential buildings. The approach is based on a performance gap analysis that takes the uncertainties in the energy evaluation methods into consideration. The scope is to verify building energy performance through simulation and analysis of measured data, identifying any performance gap due to deviations from the intended design or flaws in the finished building based on performance gap analysis. In the approach, a simulation model is calibrated to match the heat loss coefficient of the building envelope [{kWh}/K] instead of the measured energy. The introduced approach is illustrated using a single-family residential building. The heat loss coefficient was found useful towards identifying any deviations from the intended design or flaws in the finished building. The case study indicated that the method uncertainty was important to consider in the performance gap analysis and that the proposed approach is applicable even when the performance gap appears to be non-existing.},

Knowledge about the performance gap of buildings is valuable in many aspects and thus is a research subject drawing much attention. Important questions that should be asked include: (1) Deﬁnition: what is the performance gap of buildings? (2) Magnitude: how large is the performance gap of buildings? (3) Techniques: how to determine the performance gap of buildings? (4) Causes: what are the reasons leading to the performance gap of buildings? (5) Solutions: how to bridge the performance gap of buildings. By collecting and analyzing more than 20 published works with reported data on the performance gap of buildings and other research articles, these important questions are addressed. Through this review state-of-the-art knowledge regarding the performance gap of buildings is presented. Major conclusions are drawn and future research directions are pointed out.},

	abstract = {Mean Radiant Temperature ({MRT}) is an important factor of Fanger's {PMV} model, which is the most popular method to study human thermal comfort. However, it has often been a practice to assume {MRT} equal to air temperature (Ta) during indoor thermal studies. In this paper, we have studied the consequences of this simplistic assumption on the thermal comfort of occupants in air-conditioned buildings. A worldwide database of about 10000 occupants covering 9 climatic zones and 4 seasons has been studied. The effect on comfort indices-Predicted Mean Vote ({PMV}), Actual Mean Vote ({AMV}), Thermal Acceptability Vote ({TSA}) and Thermal Preference Vote ({MCI}) are presented. It is observed that even a small difference in Ta and {MRT} can lead to significant error in determination of thermal comfort. A correlation study between {AMV} and the six Macpherson factors reveals that {MRT} has the highest positive correlation with the thermal sensation reported by the occupants. Study of {TSA} and {MCI} show that the assumption is more likely to affect comfort level determination in the uncomfortable range.},

This paper investigates the simplification of past studies that the Tmrt is equal to the air temperature (Ta) under indoor conditions. In a second step, the causes for deviations between the two parameters are examined and integrated into the context of indoor climate. Measurements were conducted in four rooms at the Geography Department of Humboldt University in Berlin during autochthonal weather conditions from the 16th of August to the 2nd of September 2013. Tmrt was derived using integral radiation measurements and three different types of globe thermometers. The study indicates that the deviations between the different methods of obtaining Tmrt are negligible for indoor environments. The results show that the differences between Ta and Tmrt are negligible during most periods, as stated in previous literature. As air temperatures increase, however, Tmrt exceeds Ta up to 1.3 K. The examination of the surface temperatures indicates that rooms with window walls facing southeast and southwest show the largest disparities between Ta and Tmrt. The correlation between Ta and Tmrt and the sum of the short and long wave radiation specifies the radiation intensity and duration as the main driver of Tmrt. Future studies on indoor heat stress should hence consider that Tmrt and Ta can differ depending on the characteristics of the room and on solar radiation.},

	abstract = {We conducted a field study in a deep-plan office building equipped with suspended direct-indirect luminaires located centrally in cubicle workstations. In order to reduce lighting energy use, the luminaires employed integral occupancy sensors and light sensors (daylight harvesting), as well as individual dimming control accessed through occupants' computer screens. Data were collected from 86 workstations over a year to examine the energy savings and power reduction attributable to the controls, and how the controls were used. An awareness campaign that used e-mail reminders to encourage the occupants to use the individual control feature of the lighting system was also conducted. Results indicate that the lighting system generated substantial energy savings and peak power reductions compared to a conventional fluorescent lighting system installed on a neighboring floor. The installed lighting power was 42 percent lower than that of the conventional system. The three controls combined saved 42 to 47 percent in lighting energy use compared to the same lights used at full power during work-hours; this translated into overall savings of 67 to 69 percent compared to the conventional lighting system. If the three lighting controls systems had been installed separately, occupancy sensors would have saved, on average, 35 percent if used alone, light sensors (daylight harvesting) 20 percent, and individual dimming 11 percent. The light sensor savings were, as expected, higher in perimeter workstations, and would have matched the performance of the occupancy sensors with some modifications to the control parameters. The average daily peak power demand for lighting was also reduced by a similar amount, which resulted in an average effective lighting power density of only 3 W/m2. Although not detailed in this paper, surveys indicated that the studied lighting system was also associated with higher occupant satisfaction. This was likely due to the individual dimming control, although use of this control beyond an initial preferred setting was rare.},

As far as the lighting services are concerned, control systems offer an important opportunity of managing lighting systems and reducing energy consumption, due to the use of integration strategies between daylight and electric lighting and strategies based on the occupancy of spaces. The results of an experimental case study of ten offices in Torino (Italy), in which a custom-design building automation and control system has been designed to control both the lighting plants and the air conditioning system, are presented in this paper. The study was carried out in order to evaluate the energy efficiency of the lighting control system and to analyse the environmental luminous conditions obtained through the application of this technology to a real case. The environmental and energy performances, together with the degree of users' satisfaction and acceptance of this control system, were analysed after a year of activity to verify the potentiality and operation of this lighting control system. The obtained results regarding the potential energy savings (from 17\% to 32\%) were evaluated taking into account both the monitored annual electric energy consumption (for operation) and the parasitic energy consumption due to the installed devices (luminaire ballasts, sensors and controllers), and were compared with the estimated energy consumption calculated applying the method proposed in the European standard {EN} 15193:2007.},

In this work, we present several methods of feedback that use data presentation and environmental interaction in comfort voting applications.

Lack of information about human related variables results in using unrepresentative operational settings, which in turn could bring about low efficiency in {HVAC} operations. In this paper, the implementation and evaluation of a framework that integrates building occupants’ personalized thermal profiles into the {HVAC} control logic is presented. The framework enables occupants to communicate their preferences for indoor thermal conditions through a user interface, leveraging a participatory sensing approach. The framework learns occupants’ comfort profiles, using a fuzzy predictive model, and controls the {HVAC} system using a complementary control strategy, which enables the framework to be implemented in existing centrally controlled {HVAC} systems with minimum intrusion. Evaluation of the framework in a real building setting showed user comfort improvement. Moreover, the results showed a 39\% reduction in daily average airflow when the {HVAC} system conditions the rooms at occupants’ desired temperatures. Airflow is proportional to the energy consumption of {HVAC} system components. Consequently, the implementation of the framework shows improvements in the efficiency of the {HVAC} system's performance for centrally controlled office buildings.},

Current {HVAC} systems only condition based on static schedules; rooms are conditioned regardless of occupancy. By conditioning rooms only when necessary, greater efficiency can be achieved. This paper describes {POEM}, a complete closed-loop system for optimally controlling {HVAC} systems in buildings based on actual occupancy levels. {POEM} is comprised of multiple parts. A wireless network of cameras called {OPTNet} is developed that functions as an optical turnstile to measure area/zone occupancies. Another wireless sensor network of passive infrared ({PIR}) sensors called {BONet} functions alongside {OPTNet}. This sensed occupancy data from both systems are then fused with an occupancy prediction model using a particle filter in order to determine the most accurate current occupancy in each zone in the building. Finally, the information from occupancy prediction models and current occupancy is combined in order to find the optimal conditioning strategy required to reach target temperatures and minimize ventilation requirements. Based on live tests of the system, we estimate {\textasciitilde}30.0\% energy saving can be achieved while still maintaining thermal comfort.},

It saves energy by relaxing ambient temperature requirements for the {HVAC} system. Aside from these benefits, {PCS} offers a wealth of data that can describe how individuals interact with heating/cooling devices in their own environment. Recently developed Internet-connected {PCS} chairs have unlocked this opportunity by generating continuous streams of heating and cooling usage data, along with occupancy status and environmental measurements via embedded sensors. The data allow individuals' comfort and behavior to be learned, and can inform centralized systems to provide ‘just the right’ amount of conditioning to meet occupant needs. In summer 2016, we carried out a study with {PCS} chairs involving 37 occupants in an office building in California. During the study period, we collected {\textgreater}5 million chair usage data-points and 4500 occupant survey responses, as well as continuous measurements of environmental and {HVAC} system conditions. The data analysis shows that (1) local temperatures experienced by individual occupants vary quite widely across different parts of the building, even within the same thermal zone; (2) occupants often have different thermal preferences even under the same thermal conditions; (3) {PCS} control behavior can dynamically describe individuals' thermal preferences; (4) {PCS} chairs produce much higher comfort satisfaction (96\%) than typically achieved in buildings. We conclude that {PCS} not only provide personalized comfort solutions but also offer individualized feedback that can improve comfort analytics and control decisions in buildings.},

Upon this analysis, an adaptive lighting and blinds control algorithm was formulated. The algorithm learns occupants' illuminance preferences from their light switch-on and blinds closing behaviours, and employs this information to determine the photosensor setpoints to switch off lighting and to open blinds. The algorithm was implemented inside controllers serving five private offices and a controls laboratory – a shared office space with a standalone controls network. Alternative control scenarios were analyzed through integrated daylighting and occupant behaviour simulations. The results indicate that the use of an adaptive lighting and blinds control algorithm developed in this paper can substantially reduce the lighting loads in office buildings – without adversely affecting the occupant comfort.},

	abstract = {In commercial buildings, lighting contributes to about 20\% of the total energy consumption. Lighting controllers that integrate occupancy and luminosity sensors to improve energy efficiency have been proposed. However, they are often ineffective because they focus solely on energy consumption rather than providing comfort to the occupants. An ideal controller should adapt itself to the preferences of the occupant and the environmental conditions. In this article, we introduce {LightLearn}, an occupant centered controller ({OCC}) for lighting based on Reinforcement Learning ({RL}). We describe the theory and hardware implementation of {LightLearn}. Our experiment during eight weeks in five offices shows that {LightLearn} learns the individual occupant behaviors and indoor environmental conditions, and adapts its control parameters accordingly by determining personalized set-points. Participants reported that the overall lighting was slightly improved compared to prior lighting conditions. We compare {LightLearn} to schedule-based and occupancy-based control scenarios, and evaluate their performance with respect to total energy use, light-utilization-ratio, unmet comfort hours, as well as light-comfort-ratio, which we introduce in this paper. We show that only {LightLearn} balances successfully occupant comfort and energy consumption. The adaptive nature of {LightLearn} suggests that reinforcement learning based occupant centered control is a viable approach to mitigate the discrepancy between occupant comfort and the goals of building control.},

To this end, visual analytics techniques are exploited to visualize them in a compact and comprehensive way taking into account properties of human cognition, perception and sense making. Visual Analytics facilitates the detailed spatiotemporal analysis building performance in terms of occupancy comfort, building performance and energy consumption and exploits innovative data mining techniques and mechanisms to allow analysts to detect patterns and crucial point that are difficult to be detected otherwise, thus assisting them to further optimize the building’s operation.

This makes office buildings a target for occupant-driven demand control measures, which have been demonstrated as having huge potential to improve energy efficiency. The application of occupant-driven demand control measures in buildings, most especially in the control of thermal, visual and indoor air quality providing systems, which account for over 30\% of the energy consumed in a typical office building is however hampered due to the lack of comprehensive fine-grained occupancy information. Given that comprehensive fine-grained occupancy information improves the performance of demand-driven measures, this paper presents a review of common existing systems utilized in buildings for occupancy detection. Furthermore, experimental results from the performance evaluation of chair sensors in an office building for providing fine-grained occupancy information for demand-driven control applications are presented.},

The authors observed that the occupants interact with their thermostats infrequently (on average once every 56 h of occupancy); and when they did so, occupants changed the temperature set-point, on average, by 1°C. The authors observed that about one-third of the thermostat overrides were either to decrease the set-points during the heating season, or to increase the set-points during the cooling season. The temperatures leading to the thermostat overrides changed by ∼3°C seasonally. It was noted that the frequency of thermostat interactions can be approximated as a univariate logistic regression model that inputs the indoor temperature as the predictor variable. A recursive algorithm was formulated to develop univariate thermostat use models inside building controllers. It was implemented inside four commercial controllers serving seven private office spaces to choose operating set-points. One year after the implementation, the iterative learning process resulted in a 2°C–3°C reduction in the set-points during the heating season and a 2°C–3°C increase in the set-points during the cooling season with respect to the default 22°C set-point in both seasons.},

This model quantitatively predicts human comfort based on a set of underlying measurable environmental and personal parameters. {SPOT} uses a set of sensors, including a Microsoft Kinect, to measure the parameters underlying the {PPV} model, then controls heating and cooling elements to dynamically adjust indoor temperature to maintain comfort. Based on a deployment of {SPOT} in a real office environment, we find that {SPOT} can accurately maintain personal comfort despite environmental fluctuations and allows a worker to balance personal comfort with energy use.},

This is established from measurements of a host of environmental variables and analysis of before-after occupant survey results. We present a complete system to retrofit existing buildings including the control algorithm and the supporting execution platform which includes the deployment of a wireless sensor network.

The core purpose of this solar-assisted air-conditioning system is to handle the cooling and heating load of the Solar Energy Research Centre ({CIESOL}), thus minimising its environmental impact. In this study, the cooling mode was investigated with special attention focused on the chilled-water storage circuit. The critical concern is that the solar-assisted air-conditioning system should always operate considering the actual load conditions, not using an abstract maximum load that is predetermined during the system’s design process, which can lead to energy waste during periods of low occupancy. Thus, the fundamental problem is to identify the optimum operation sequence for the solar-assisted air-conditioning system that provides the best energy performance. The significance of this work lies in the demonstration of a new operation strategy that utilises real-time occupancy monitoring and chilled-water storage tanks to improve the efficiency of solar-assisted air-conditioning systems, thereby reducing their electricity consumption. Adopting this strategy resulted in a large energy-saving potential. The results demonstrate that during one cooling period, it is possible to conserve approximately 42\% of the total electrical energy consumed by the system prior to the adoption of this operation strategy.},

In this article, we present {WinLight}, a novel occupancy-driven lighting control system that aims to reduce energy consumption while simultaneously preserving the lighting comfort of occupants. By leveraging the fine-grained occupancy information estimated by existing {WiFi} infrastructure in a non-intrusive manner, {WinLight} computes an appropriate dimming command for each lamp based on a novel lighting control algorithm. A centralized lighting control system assigns these commands to a zonal gateway, and occupancy-driven lighting control is achieved by actuating the brightness adjustment with a local controller integrated within each lamp. Moreover, a {WinLight} App is designed to enable occupants to customize their luminance preferences and to control nearby lamps using their mobile devices. We implemented {WinLight} in a 1500m2 multi-functional office in Singapore and conducted an experiment during 24 weeks. The experimental results demonstrate that {WinLight} achieves 93.09\% and 80.27\% energy savings compared to static scheduling lighting control scheme and {PIR} sensor based lighting control scheme while guaranteeing the personalized lighting comfort of each occupant.},

We have designed a mobile application that occupants can use on their smart phones to provide their thermal preference feedback. When relaying the occupant feedback to the central server the mobile application also uses indoor location techniques to tie the occupant preference to their current thermal zone. Texas Instruments sensortags are used for real time zonal temperature readings. The mobile application relays the occupant preference along with the location to a central server that also hosts our learning algorithm to learn the environment and using occupant feedback calculates the optimal temperature set point. The entire process is triggered upon change of occupancy, environmental conditions, and/or occupant preference. The learning algorithm is scheduled to run at regular intervals to respond dynamically to environmental and occupancy changes.

We compared {PreHeat}'s prediction algorithm with a static program over an average 61 days per house, alternating days between these conditions, and measuring actual gas consumption and occupancy. In {UK} homes {PreHeat} both saved gas and reduced {MissTime} (the time that the house was occupied but not warm).

	abstract = {Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning ({HVAC}) are vital components in providing a comfortable indoor climate for the occupants of buildings. In commercial buildings, {HVAC} setpoints are set according to average comfort temperatures. However, individual temperature preferences may be different. The purpose of this study is to explore the means of making {HVAC} systems respond automatically to local occupant temperature preferences. To create an occupant-centric indoor temperature environment, we propose an online-learning-based control strategy together with its design process. Four essential variables from four domains—time, indoor and outdoor climates, and occupant behavior—are extracted to construct datasets for preference models. A neural network algorithm and corresponding hyperparameters are suggested to model temperature preferences. According to time-dependent setpoints learned from dynamic contexts, a set of specified rules is used to determine setpoints for {HVAC} systems. For a period of five months, the resulting learning-based temperature preference control ({LTPC}) was applied to a cooling system of an office space under real-world conditions. The four case study rooms consisted of typical office uses: single-person and multi-person offices. The experimental results indicate that occupant preferences in the individual rooms differ from each other in both time horizon and temperature levels. The results report energy savings of between 4\% and 25\% as compared to static temperature setpoints at the low values of preferred temperature ranges. Meanwhile, during {LPTC}, the need for occupant interventions for adjusting room temperatures to fit their preferences was reduced from four to nine weekdays a month to a maximum of one weekday a month.},

	abstract = {Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning ({HVAC}) are among the major energy demand in the buildings sector globally. Improving the energy efficiency of such systems is a critical objective for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning towards renewable sources of energy supply. The interest of this paper is to explore means to increase the efficiency of {HVAC} systems in accommodating occupants’ behavior in real time. For instance, rooms in office buildings are not always occupied by occupants during scheduled {HVAC} service periods. This offers an opportunity to reduce unnecessary energy demands of {HVAC} systems associated with occupants’ behavior. An in-depth analysis of occupants’ stochastic behavior within an office building is conducted in this paper. A demand-driven control strategy is proposed that automatically responds to occupants’ energy-related behavior for reducing energy consumption and maintains room temperature for occupants with similar performances as a static cooling. In this control strategy, two types of machine learning methods – unsupervised and supervised learning – are applied to learn occupants’ behavior in two learning processes. The occupancy-related information learned by the algorithms is used by a set of specified rules to infer real-time room setpoints for controlling the office's space cooling system. This learning-based approach intends to reduce the need for human intervention in the cooling system’s control. The proposed strategy was applied to control the cooling system of the office building under real-world conditions. Eleven case study office spaces were selected, representing three typical office uses: single person offices, multi-person offices, and meeting rooms. The experimental results report between 7\% and 52\% energy savings as compared to the conventionally-scheduled cooling systems.},

This paper presents the implementation of the controller and the measured performance in comparison with the default, rule-based control ({RBC}). The building has two floors and a total size of 960m2. The controllable system is the hybrid heat production consisting of two air/water heat pumps and a condensing gas boiler. The practical situation does not allow controlling end-units in the different zones of the building. The {MPC} makes use of a Modelica grey-box control model resulting from a system identification with monitoring data. The paper covers the monitoring, model identification, forecasting of disturbances, state estimation, formulation and solving of the optimal control problem ({OCP}) and transmission of the control signals. The performance is evaluated on a daily basis based on analysis of heating degree days, thermal comfort, energy costs and primary energy consumption. The results show that the model predictive controller is able to provide a similar or better thermal comfort than the reference control while reducing the energy costs by more than 30\%. This is due among others, to a better use of the heat pumps and an adapted hot water supply temperature.},

All three lamps turned on and off according to occupancy on a workstation-by-workstation basis. Field measurements taken over the course of several months demonstrated 40 percent lighting energy savings compared to a baseline that represents a typical Federal building retrofit; the baseline has a lighting power density of 8.9W/m2 (0.83W/ft2) and no advanced controls. A photometric analysis found that the installation provided higher desktop light levels than the baseline did, while an occupant survey suggested that occupants preferred the lighting system to the baseline.This document was prepared as an account of work sponsored by the United States Government.

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the application of sensor networks to lighting control, and had two goals. The first goal was to evaluate the utility of using more than one sensor to detect occupancy. Sensor networks were installed in a sample of private offices and cubicle workstations. Large individual differences in sensor response to occupancy were observed in all monitored areas: the percent difference in occupied time measured by sensors in ten private offices ranged from 16.1 percent to 74.0 percent (mean 44.7 percent): the differences between detectors measuring occupancy in 23 cubicle workstations ranged from 14 percent to 91 percent (mean 53.7 percent). These data establish the considerable uncertainty in occupancy measurement that exists with current systems. Current control systems compensate for this uncertainty by applying a long time delay before switching lights off. Since a sensor network more accurately measures occupancy, shorter time delays can be applied to reduce system operating time and save energy. Applying a 5-minute time delay to sensor network data, instead of the 20 minutes that is more typical in current single sensor applications, reduced operating time by an additional 22.4 percent to 33.3 percent (relative to the reductions that would have resulted from use of a single sensor). A longer time delay of 10 minutes applied to the sensor network data stream produced reductions of 8.4 percent to 24.7 percent, relative to the reduction that would have resulted from use of a single sensor with a 20-minute time delay.},

	abstract = {Occupancy sensors have long been used for control of various devices (like artificial light, {HVAC} devices, etc.). Past research has shown that use of occupancy sensors for control of lighting can save up to 30\% electrical energy used for lighting. However, most of the sensors, which are currently being put to use, have a preset (sometimes user adjustable) time delay ({TD}) (the time after which the lights or any other load will be switched “off” after the last motion is detected by the sensor). If this {TD} is long then, it will have less energy savings, as the load will remain “on” during unoccupied period also. At the same time, if the {TD} is kept short then it may result in unwanted switching “off” (False Off) of the lights when no motion is detected during periods of occupancy. It has been observed in our research that the activity level of a user changes over the time of the day. Also, it is seen that activity level of different users is different. Hence, single {TD} for all the users and for all times of the day is not desirable. The commonly used sensors do not adapt to changing activity levels. In this paper, we present design of smart occupancy sensors which can adapt to changing activity levels. A model is also proposed for “human movement” of a person working at a computer. Smart occupancy sensor can learn the variation in activity level of the occupants with respect to time of the day. With this information, it can change the {TD} with time of the day. Experiments conducted have shown that about 5\% more energy can be saved by using smart occupancy sensor as compared to non-adapting fixed {TD} sensors.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in information and communication technology have sparked the notion of smart buildings; an example of which is occupant-centric control ({OCC}). In this approach, a control system acquires various data from occupants, the indoor environment, and outdoor climate, and learns or derives useful information for building control, e.g., room occupancy patterns and adaptive set-points. Ultimately, these adaptive control parameters are used to improve both occupant comfort and energy efficiency. Typical {OCC} approaches have been put forward in concept papers, small-scale experiments, as well as simulations. However, there are relatively few studies in which {OCC} is implemented in real buildings. In this article, we review {OCC} research, focusing on field-implementation case studies in actual buildings under realistic use conditions. First, we analyze the topical aspects of these studies, e.g., building types, location, and building systems. Next, we present a methodological review focusing on the different approaches used to implement {OCC} in existing building systems. Lastly, we investigate the experimental design approach of the reviewed case studies, focusing on measurement and verification techniques. Results highlight wide discrepancies in the implementation approach of {OCC} case studies and identify common challenges facing {OCC} in actual buildings. We propose future directions for {OCC} research by providing recommendations to address these challenges and to standardize {OCC} implementations.},

This article provides an answer to the question: “What is the most common practice for human thermal comfort experiments in (semi-)controlled environments?”. A total of 166 articles presenting results on 206 experiments were collected and analyzed to extrapolate the most common practice. The results are arranged in five main themes: subjects (e.g. number and age), climate chamber (e.g. surface area), thermal environment, experimental procedure (e.g. phases and duration), and questionnaire. A typical experiment was found to employ 25 subjects and to take place in a permanent climate chamber with a floor area of 24m2 During the experiment, 3 air temperature variations are used. The test itself takes 115min, but is preceded by a preconditioning and conditioning phase. The subject is given a questionnaire at regular intervals of 15min, with questions highly dependent on topic, but including thermal sensation and comfort vote rated on a bipolar 7-level scale. Number of subjects, gender distribution, type and floor area of the climate chamber and utilization rate of the scale for rating thermal comfort and sensation are all linked to topic, as well as number of different air temperatures, whether conditioning is employed and questions in the questionnaire. Several links between experiment characteristics reciprocally are also identified.},

	abstract = {Buildings have a major contribution to the global energy consumption. Heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems ({HVAC}) are responsible for most of the energy use in buildings. Thus, clean and sustainable alternatives such as free cooling of buildings have recently gained much attention as means to reduce the operation hours and capacity of the conventional cooling and heating systems. The free cooling could be provided by collecting the natural cold energy during night time in appropriate thermal storage form and this could be retrieved when needed. Phase change materials are exploited by a number of investigators as a storage medium in free cooling applications, as these substances possess high energy densities, and absorb and release heat at a narrow temperature range, hence, the comfort temperature can be maintained day and night. The objectives of this article are to provide a comprehensive review on recent development on free cooling technologies incorporating latent heat storage and to shit lights on the most significant parameters affecting the performance of these materials in free cooling strategy. The outcomes of this review would be helpful in providing clear insight information on potential improvements that can be applied to the storage materials. All the reviewed studies demonstrated that the night cooling strategy using {PCMs} has the capacity to maintain the indoor temperature well within the comfort zone whilst providing a considerable reduction in cooling loads in all considered climates.},

After explaining its historical growth, the applicability of passive and active approaches has been described, considering well-established and emerging techniques, general procedures, types of {IR}-camera used, technical issues, and limitations. The passive approach is the most common to detect thermally significant defects. Thus, a specific procedure for the energy audit has been reported, matching different standards, guidelines, and professional advice. Similarly, recurring energy related problems are toughly presented (i.e. thermal characterization of buildings; thermal bridging, insulation level, air leakage and moisture detection; indoor temperature and U-value measurements; human comfort assessment). Finally, advantages and potential sources of errors as well as future trends in the use of {IRT} for the energy audit have been described. The research aims to serve as a reference for energy auditors and thermographers, to decide upon the best procedure for detecting specific energy defects.},

Therefore a need exists for a fuller treatment of the subject in the light of literature from M\&V and other fields. This paper surveys general M\&V literature, as well as relevant research from metrology, electrical engineering, economics, decision analysis, and statistics. Electrical metering and sub-metering uncertainty is investigated, as well as often-overlooked considerations such as power quality and the cost of calibration. The effect of mismeasurement on energy models and practical techniques for mitigating such effects are assessed. Last, research on building simulation and project decisions in the light of measurement error is surveyed. Bayesian methods are found to be a recurring theme in much of the research being conducted on all of these aspects. Power quality and mismeasurement effects have also been found to make a material difference in project evaluation.

Thus, balancing the two is necessary for a sustainable and comfortable building stock. We review both research fields and their relationship using a data-driven approach. Based on specific search terms, all relevant abstracts from the Web Of Science database are downloaded and analyzed using the text mining software {VOSviewer}. We visualize the scientific landscapes of historic and recent trends, and analyze the citation network to investigate the interaction between thermal comfort and building control research. We find that building control focuses predominantly on energy savings rather than incorporating results from thermal comfort, especially when it comes to occupant satisfaction.

We have re-evaluated, by review of the literature, how low relative humidity ({RH}) may influence the immediately perceived indoor air quality ({IAQ}), including odour, and cause irritation symptoms (i.e. longer-term perceived {IAQ}). “Relative humidity” were searched in major databases, and combined with: air quality, cabin air, dry eyes, formaldehyde, inflammation, mucous membranes, offices, ozone, pungency, sensory irritation, particles, precorneal tear film, sick building syndrome, stuffy air, and {VOCs}. The impact of {RH} on the immediately and longer-term perceived {IAQ} by {VOCs}, ozone, and particles is complex, because both the thermodynamic condition and the emission characteristics of building materials are influenced. Epidemiological, clinical, and human exposure studies indicate that low {RH} plays a role in the increase of reporting eye irritation symptoms and alteration of the precorneal tear film. These effects may be exacerbated during visual display unit work. The recommendation that {IAQ} should be “dry and cool” may be useful for evaluation of the immediately perceived {IAQ} in material emission testing, but should be considered cautiously about the development of irritation symptoms in eyes and upper airways during a workday. Studies indicate that {RH} about 40\% is better for the eyes and upper airways than levels below 30\%. The optimal {RH} may differ for the eyes and the airways regarding desiccation of the mucous membranes.},

Heating, ventilating and air-conditioning ({HVAC}) system constitutes 40\% of the total energy consumption in a typical commercial building. While the main objective of {HVAC} is to provide occupants with a comfort and safe environment, it currently lacks channels to recognize occupants' favourite temperatures as well as reflect their levels of comfort, e.g., too-cold or too-hot. Hence, it is hard to justify the energy consumption without considering end-user needs. Models of thermal comfort and predicted mean vote have been used to estimate such index, however, they are not widely adopted due to their complexity and inaccuracy. In this paper, we design the innovative system {CarryEn}, which first captures user's favourite temperature non-intrusively from their daily environment. We connect our system with the building management system ({BMS}), and optimize the setpoint temperature to occupants with our model. When the user moves into other rooms or buildings, his favourite setting will also be carried with him. Based on our experiments, {CarryEn} is able to achieve an improvement of 28.2\% thermal satisfaction from occupants and save 13\% of energy consumption.},

A comparative experiment, including both physiological measurements and subjective questionnaires, was conducted in China where winter indoor climates in the northern region (with pervasive district heating) are much warmer than the southern region (without district heating). Two subject groups were recruited, namely: (a) N–N group - subjects who had lived in the northern China with district heating all their life, and (b) S–N group - subjects who grew up in the southern region without district heating but recently moved to the north. The results indicate that S–N subjects who had lived their entire lives in cold wintertime indoor climates had slither physiological response and felt less uncomfortable in mild cold exposures than N–N subjects who lived in neutral-to-warm wintertime indoor climates. The findings suggest that indoor thermal exposures can also influence occupants' thermal adaptation, which can reserve as a reference to the future adaptive thermal comfort model.},

	abstract = {Measurements of skin temperatures are often complicated because of the use of wired sensors. This is so in field studies, but also holds for many laboratory conditions. This article describes a wireless temperature system for human skin temperature measurements, i.e. the Thermochron {iButton} {DS}1291H. The study deals with validation of the {iButton} and its application on the human skin, and describes clinical and field measurements. The validation study shows that {iButtons} have a mean accuracy of −0.09 °C (−0.4 °C at most) with a precision of 0.05 °C (0.09 °C at most). These properties can be improved by using calibration. Due to the size of the device the response time is longer than that of conventional sensors, with a τ in water of 19 s. On the human skin under transient conditions the response time is significantly longer, revealing momentary deviations with a magnitude of 1 °C. The use of {iButtons} has been described in studies on circadian rhythms, sleep and cardiac surgery. With respect to circadian rhythm and sleep research, skin temperature assessment by {iButtons} is of significant value in laboratory, clinical and home situations. We demonstrate that differences in laboratory and field measurements add to our understanding of thermophysiology under natural living conditions. The advantage of {iButtons} in surgery research is that they are easy to sterilize and wireless so that they do not hinder the surgical procedure. In conclusion, the application of {iButtons} is advantageous for measuring skin temperatures in those situations in which wired instruments are unpractical and fast responses are not required.},

	abstract = {Skin temperature is a fundamental variable in human thermo-physiology, and yet skin temperature measurement remains impractical in most free-living, exercise and clinical settings, using currently available hard-wired methods. The purpose of this study was to compare wireless {iButtons}® and hard-wired thermistors for human skin temperature measurement. In the first of two investigations, {iButtons}® and thermistors monitored temperature in a controlled water bath (range: 10–40 °C) and were referenced against a certified, mercury thermometer. In the second investigation, eight healthy males completed three randomized trials (ambient temperature = 10 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C) while both devices recorded skin temperature at rest (in low and high wind velocities) and during cycle-ergometry exercise. The results are as follows; Investigation 1: both devices displayed very high validity correlation with the reference thermometer (r {\textgreater} 0.999). Prior to correction, the mean bias was +0.121 °C for {iButtons}® and +0.045 °C for thermistors. Upon calibration correction the mean bias for {iButtons}® and thermistors was not significantly different from zero bias. Interestingly, the typical error of the estimate of {iButtons}® (0.043 °C) was 1.5 times less than that of thermistors (0.062 °C), demonstrating {iButtons}'® lower random error. Investigation 2: the offset between {iButton}® and thermistor readings was generally consistent across conditions; however, thermistor responses gave readings that were always closer to ambient temperature than those given by {iButtons}®, suggesting potential thermistor drift towards environmental conditions. Mean temperature differences between {iButtons}® and thermistors during resting trials ranged from 0.261 °C to 1.356 °C. Mean temperature differences between {iButtons}® and thermistors during exercise were 0.989 °C (ambient temperature = 10 °C), 0.415 °C (ambient temperature = 20 °C) and 0.318 °C (ambient temperature = 30 °C). Observed error estimates were within the acceptable limits for the skin temperature method comparison, with typical errors 0.9 and {CV} {\textless}1\% under all conditions. These findings indicate that wireless {iButtons}® provide a valid alternative for human skin temperature measurement during laboratory and field investigations particularly when skin temperature measurement using other currently available methods may prove problematic.},

	abstract = {Performance monitoring using wireless sensors is now common practice in building operation and maintenance and generates a large amount of building specific data. However, it is difficult for occupants, owners and operators to explore such data and understand underlying patterns. This is especially true in buildings which involve complex interactions, such as ventilation, solar gains, internal gains and thermal mass. Performance monitoring requires collecting data concerning energy consumption and ambient environmental conditions to model and optimise buildings' energy consumption. This paper details the use of data mining techniques in understanding building energy performance of geothermal, solar and gas burning energy systems. The paper is part of an outgoing research into optimisation of building performance under hybrid energy regimes. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to predict comfort levels based on the Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning ({HVAC}) system performance and external environmental conditions. A C4.5 classification methodology is used to analyse a combination of internal and external ambient conditions. The mining algorithms are used to determine comfort constraints and the influence of external conditions on a building's internal user comfort. To test the performance of classification and its use in prediction, different offices, one to the south and the other to the north of the building are used. Classification rules being developed are analysed for their application to modify control algorithms and to apply results to generalise hybrid system performance. The results of this study can be generalised for an entire building, or a set of buildings, under a single energy network subject to the same constraints.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the relationship of thermal sensations of local body segments and the whole body for a better understanding of how to estimate the overall thermal perception, as a function of partial body sensations, while considering human factors such as gender and body mass index. Thermal comfort, which can be expressed as a function of thermal dynamics between the human body and ambient thermal conditions, primarily consists of a combination of local thermal perceptions. An individual body area contributes to an overall thermal sensation at different significance levels, so that specific areas have high potential for determining the whole-body sensation. This is especially true in a typical building environment where thermal conditions are uniformly distributed and no extremely cold or hot condition occurs. For this study, a series of human subject experiments was conducted with 18 volunteers in an environmental chamber, while thermal conditions changed and thermal sensations were surveyed in the regular way. Seven local body areas were selected, based on current thermoregulation-related literature, and their local body sensations were recorded together. This study revealed that each local body sensation significantly correlated with the overall sensation, but that whole-body sensations varied for each individual body area. In addition, results of this research also suggested optimal combinations of local body areas that could represent the whole-body sensation with a high degree of accuracy.},

	abstract = {Human thermal sensation in an environment may be delayed, which may lead to life threatening conditions, such as hypothermia and hyperthermia. This is especially true for senior citizens, as aging alters the thermal perception in humans. We envision a decision support system that predicts human thermal comfort in real-time using various environmental conditions as well psychological and physiological features, and suggest corresponding actions, which can significantly improve overall thermal comfort and health of individuals, especially senior citizens. The key to realize this vision is an accurate thermal comfort model. We propose a novel machine learning based approach to learn an individual's thermal comfort model. This approach identifies the best set of features, and then learns a classifier that takes a feature vector as input and outputs a corresponding thermal sensation class (i.e. “feeling cold”, “neutral” and “feeling warm”). Evaluation using a large-scale publicly available data demonstrates that when using Support Vector Machines ({SVM}) classifiers, the accuracy of our approach is 76.7\%, over two times higher than that of the widely adopted Fanger's model (which only achieves accuracy of 35.4\%). In addition, our study indicates that two factors, a person's age and outdoor temperature that are not included in Fanger's model, play an important role in thermal comfort, which is a finding interesting in its own right.},

	abstract = {1 Time and energy are key currencies in animal ecology, and judicious management of these is a primary focus for natural selection. At present, however, there are only two main methods for estimation of rate of energy expenditure in the field, heart rate and doubly labelled water, both of which have been used with success; but both also have their limitations. 2 The deployment of data loggers that measure acceleration is emerging as a powerful tool for quantifying the behaviour of free-living animals. Given that animal movement requires the use of energy, the accelerometry technique potentially has application in the quantification of rate of energy expenditure during activity. 3 In the present study, we test the hypothesis that acceleration can serve as a proxy for rate of energy expenditure in free-living animals. We measured rate of energy expenditure as rates of O2 consumption () and {CO}2 production () in great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) at rest and during pedestrian exercise. and were then related to overall dynamic body acceleration ({ODBA}) measured with an externally attached three-axis accelerometer. 4 Both and were significantly positively associated with {ODBA} in great cormorants. This suggests that accelerometric measurements of {ODBA} can be used to estimate and and, with some additional assumptions regarding metabolic substrate use and the energy equivalence of O2 and {CO}2, that {ODBA} can be used to estimate the activity specific rate of energy expenditure of free-living cormorants. 5 To verify that the approach identifies expected trends in from situations with variable power requirements, we measured {ODBA} in free-living imperial cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) during foraging trips. We compared {ODBA} during return and outward foraging flights, when birds are expected to be laden and not laden with captured fish, respectively. We also examined changes in {ODBA} during the descent phase of diving, when power requirements are predicted to decrease with depth due to changes in buoyancy associated with compression of plumage and respiratory air. 6 In free-living imperial cormorants, {ODBA}, and hence estimated , was higher during the return flight of a foraging bout, and decreased with depth during the descent phase of a dive, supporting the use of accelerometry for the determination of activity-specific rate of energy expenditure.},

Building design frameworks have reduced these concepts to measurable parameters, such as thermal neutrality, but accumulating evidence shows this to be unsupportive of wider occupant, organizational or environmental needs. This supports calls for more adaptive standards and personal control to account for variation in human perceptions of comfort and well-being. Understanding of the socio-technical dynamics of comfort and well-being as they are negotiated and experienced in the different settings of everyday life is another relatively unexplored area of academic debate. This article reviews these different understandings of comfort and well-being and the approaches to intelligent and sustainable building practice they inspire.

	abstract = {The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors and past thermal history modify building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. One of the predictions of the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This is contrary to the static assumptions underlying the current {ASHRAE} comfort standard 55-92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55-92, the {ASHRAE} {RP}-884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21,000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static predicted means vote ({PMV}) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in {HVAC} buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation. These results formed the basis of a proposal for a variable indoor temperature standard.},

	abstract = {The experimental basis of the adaptive approach to thermal comfort is the field study. Since the publication of Bedford's study in 1936, many researchers have collected data on people's thermal comfort in everyday conditions. The principal assemblages of data are those of Humphreys (1975; 1978; 1981), de Dear et al (1997), de Dear (1998), de Dear and Brager (1998) and {McCartney} and Nicol (2001). In addition there exist numerous studies not included in any assemblage. The data come from a variety of climates and countries, from people in buildings that are heated or cooled mechanically, and from buildings operating without either heating or cooling. This paper compares the more recent data with the early patterns revealed by Humphreys' 1975–1981 analyses of the worldwide data. The comparison is made for indices of thermal comfort, mean warmth response, temperatures found to be comfortable, sensitivity to temperature change, interpersonal variation, distribution of comfort with temperature, and the influence of outdoor temperature in the presence or absence of heating and cooling. The empirical findings are compared with predictions from the predicted mean vote ({PMV}) model of comfort. The role of the adaptive approach in the formation of standards and guidelines is discussed.},

Although occupants were in their respective Sedentary cluster for 80\% or more of the time, the Sedentary cluster was not limited by the currently used metabolic level for estimating sitting at a desk and working. Overall, just 30.7\% of the recorded activity levels were less than or equal to the desk-work activity levels.

	abstract = {Current thermal/sensation models primarily rely on predefined formulas or empirically defined recommendations, but fail to consider each individual's physiological characteristics. Such models frequently ignore occupants' diverse physical conditions and, therefore, have critical limitations in estimating each individual's thermal sensation levels. Since the human body is governed by the thermoregulation principle to balance the heat flux between the ambient thermal condition and the body itself, skin temperature has a significant role in maintaining this physiological principle. Therefore, this study investigated the potential use of skin temperature and its technical parameters in establishing a thermal sensation. By using advanced modern sensing technologies, and existing thermal regulation model research, this study selected and validated seven body areas as significant local body segments for determining overall thermal sensation. A series of environmental chamber tests were conducted for 2 h. While the indoor temperature fluctuated between 20 °C and 30 °C, skin temperatures of the seven selected body areas were measured in conjunction with a thermal sensation and comfort survey. Results of this study revealed that combinations of skin temperatures for the arm, back, and wrist provided the significant information needed to accurately estimate the thermal sensations of each user. Most of all, both sides of the wrist generated accurate data more than 94\% of the time. Therefore, considering the modern advanced wearable sensing technologies, results of this study confirmed that optimum combinations of skin temperature information from selected body areas, is reliable and generally applicable for estimating individual thermal sensations.},

	abstract = {The common practice of defining operational settings for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning ({HVAC}) systems in buildings is to use fixed set points, which assume occupants have same and static comfort requirements. However, thermal comfort varies from person to person and also changes due to climatic variations or acclimation, making it dynamic. In addition, thermal comfort in transient conditions are different from the steady state conditions, which makes the prediction of thermal comfort more difficult. Thus, thermal comfort has to be monitored over time. In this paper, we present a novel infrared thermography based technique to monitor an individual's thermoregulation performance and thermal comfort levels by measuring the skin temperature on several points on human face, which has a high density of blood vessels and is not usually covered by clothing. Unlike other methods, our method requires no continuous user input or interaction. Our results demonstrate that the monitored facial points behave differently under the heat and cold stresses and it can be explained based on the underlying vascular territories. We define two heuristics to describe the thermoneutral zone based on the observed behaviors and estimate thermal comfort for individuals with 95\% confidence level. Considerable variations are observed in the thermoregulation performance and uncomfortably cool conditions metrics between the males and females. Females' thermoregulation system responses are less sensitive to the perception of warm conditions. However, similar behaviors are observed for uncomfortably cool conditions across genders.},

To date, validation of energy expenditure ({EE}) predictions from accelerometers has been restricted to short laboratory or simulated free-living protocols. This study seeks to determine the capabilities of eight previously published regression equations for three commercially available accelerometers to predict summary measures of daily {EE}. Methods and Procedures: Study participants were outfitted with {ActiGraph}, Actical, and {RT}3 accelerometers, while measurements were simultaneously made during overnight stays in a room calorimeter, which provided minute-by-minute {EE} measurements, in a diverse subject population (n = 85). Regression equations for each device were used to predict the minute-by-minute metabolic equivalents ({METs}) along with the daily {PA} level ({PAL}). Results: Two {RT}3 regressions and one {ActiGraph} regression were not significantly different from calorimeter measured {PAL}. When data from the entire visit were divided into four intensity categories—sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous—significant (P {\textless} 0.001) over- and underpredictions were detected in numerous regression equations and intensity categories. Discussion: Most {EE} prediction equations showed differences of {\textless}2\% in the moderate and vigorous intensity categories. These differences, though small in magnitude, may limit the ability of these regressions to accurately characterize whether specific {PA} goals have been met in the field setting. New regression equations should be developed if more accurate prediction of the daily {PAL} or higher precision in determining the time spent in specific {PA} intensity categories is desired.},

Skin temperatures from eight healthy subjects were acquired while thermal sensation varied. To develop a thermal sensation estimation model, the mean skin temperature, temperature gradient, time differential of the temperatures, and average power of frequency band were calculated. A thermal sensation estimation model using temperatures of the fingertip and wrist showed the highest accuracy (mean root mean square error [{RMSE}]: 1.26 ± 0.31). An estimation model based on the three wrist skin temperatures showed a slightly better result to the model that used a single fingertip skin temperature (mean {RMSE}: 1.39 ± 0.18). When a personalized thermal sensation estimation model based on three wrist skin temperatures was used, the mean {RMSE} was 1.06 ± 0.29, and the correlation coefficient was 0.89.

	abstract = {Sensory estimates of comfort and thermal sensation for resting-sitting unclothed subjects have been compared with the associated physiological responses for the range of ambient temperatures (12°–48°C) under steady-state and transient conditions. For steady exposure to cold and warm environments, thermal comfort and neutral temperature sensations lie in the range for physiological thermal neutrality (28°–30°C), in which there is no physiological temperature regulatory effort. Discomfort increases more rapidly below 28°C than above 30°C, while thermal sensation for both heat and cold increases rapidly each side of neutral. Discomfort correlates best with lowering average skin temperature toward cold environments and with increased sweating toward hot environments. In general, discomfort is associated with a change of average body temperature from 36.5°C. The same conclusion follows for transient changes when the subject goes from comfortable to uncomfortable, neutral to cold, and neutral to warm. When these transients are reversed (i.e., cold to neutral, hot to neutral), the sensations of comfort and temperature “lead” the body temperature changes and are thus “anticipatory.” This hysteresis effect is most striking in the cold and less so for warmth. For transients from cold to warm, the rate of rise of skin temperature causes a sensation that compensates for and predominates over the sensation of discomfort caused by a low skin temperature itself. Finally, thermal discomfort is an excellent stimulus for behavioral activity by man. As a sensation, it gives man both an early and anticipatory drive for conscious action that may effect changes in his body's microclimate rather than having him depend on natural but short-term means of thermal protection—sweating, vasodilation, vasoconstriction and shivering.},

However, centralized {HVAC} systems cannot guarantee the provision of a comfortable thermal environment for everyone. Therefore, a personalized {HVAC} system that aims to adapt thermal preferences has drawn much more attention. Meanwhile, occupant-related factors like skin temperature have not had standardized measurement methods. Therefore, this paper proposes to use infrared thermography to develop individual thermal models to predict thermal sensations using three different feature sets with the random forest ({RF}) and support vector machine ({SVM}). The results have shown the correlation coefficients between clothing surface temperature and thermal sensation are 11\% and 3\% higher than those between skin temperature and thermal sensation of two subjects, respectively. With cross-validation, {SVM} with a linear kernel and penalty number of 1, as well as {RF} with 50 trees and the maximum tree depth of 3 were selected as the model configurations. As a result, the model trained with the feature set, consisting of indoor air temperature, relative humidity, skin temperature and clothing surface temperature, and with linear kernel {SVM} has achieved 100\% recall score on test data of female subjects and 95\% recall score on that of male subjects.},

To explore this opportunity, we deployed a sensing system in seven homes and collected self-report data from 11 participants for four weeks. Our system captures many factors employed in previous thermal comfort research, as well as new factors (e.g., activity level, sweat level). Machine learning-based models derived from the collected data show improvement over previous techniques, however significant prediction errors remain. In analyzing these errors we identify six problems that pose challenges for inferring comfort in the wild.

Office temperature, relative humidity, exposed skin temperature and clothing temperature were automatically measured over approximately 27 min per subject, using remote sensors and avoiding any contact with the subjects. Thermal comfort levels were evaluated using subjects feedback, recorded every minute for the entire experiment. Clothing insulation and metabolic rate were kept relatively constant for this experiment (0.54 clo and 1.1 met). Average skin temperature was extracted from five different locations, with average temperatures of 33.5 °C, 34.5 °C, and 35.6 °C corresponding to cold discomfort, comfort and warm discomfort respectively. Average clothing temperature was also extracted from three different location, with 32.3 °C, 33.8 °C and 35.0 °C corresponding to the same three comfort levels. Relative humidity levels were similar for all subjects, with average values between 38\% and 33\%. Results showed significant correlation between observed skin temperature, clothing temperature and thermal comfort level. Also, collected data showed that the temperature difference between different body locations was highly correlated with thermal comfort, and the variance of skin temperature over a small area was significantly correlated with thermal comfort. The results suggest that non-invasive thermographic cameras that combine visual and thermal modes are sufficiently accurate in real-world settings to drive control of {HVAC} systems.},

We propose a non-invasive approach for automatic prediction of personal thermal comfort and mean time to warm discomfort using machine learning. The prediction framework described uses temperature information extracted from multiple local body parts to model an individual's thermal preference, with sensing measurements that capture local body part variance as well as differences between body parts. We compared the efficacy of using machine learning with classical measurements such as skin temperature along with our approach of using multi-part measurements and derived data. An analysis of the performance of machine learning shows that our method improved the accuracy of personal thermal comfort prediction by an average of 60\%, and the accuracy of mean time to warm discomfort prediction by an average of 40\%. The proposed thermal models were tested on subjects’ data extracted from an office setup with room temperature varying from low (21.11 °C) to high (27.78 °C). When all proposed features were used, personal thermal comfort was predicted with an accuracy higher than 80\% and mean time to warm discomfort with more than 85\% accuracy. Further analysis of the machine learning efficacy showed that temperature differences had the highest impact on performance of individual thermal preference prediction, while the proposed approach was found not sensitive to the actual machine learning algorithm.},

Data were accumulated from two studies to consider potential use for either individuals or a group of occupants. Using a single skin temperature correctly predicts 80\% of thermal demands. Using combined skin temperatures from different body segments can improve the model to over 90\% accuracy. Results show that three skin locations contained enough information for classification and more would cause the curse of dimensionality. Models using different skin temperatures were compared.

A positive temperature gradient (finger warmer than the forearm) of as much as 2K was seen when subjects felt warm and hot, while a negative temperature gradient (finger colder than the forearm) as much as 8.5K was seen for cool and cold subjects. A useful warm/cold boundary of 30°C was found in finger temperature, for both steady state and transient conditions. When finger temperature was above 30°C, or finger-forearm skin temperature gradient above 0K, there was no cool discomfort. When finger temperature was below 30°C, or the finger-forearm skin temperature gradient less than 0K, cool discomfort was a possibility. Finger temperature and finger-forearm temperature gradient are very similar in their correlation to overall sensation.

At present, such systems use simple models of user comfort when deciding on a set point temperature. These models generally fail to adapt to an individual user's preferences, resulting in poor estimates of a user's preferred temperature. To address this issue, we propose a personalised thermal comfort model that uses a Bayesian network to learn and adapt to a user's individual preferences. Through an empirical evaluation based on the {ASHRAE} {RP}-884 data set, we show that our model is consistently 17.5- 23.5\% more accurate than current models, regardless of environmental conditions and the type of heating system used. Our model is not limited to a single metric but can also infer information about expected user feedback, optimal comfort temperature and thermal sensitivity at the same time, which can be used to reduce energy used for heating with minimal comfort loss.},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort has become a topic issue in building performance assessment as well as energy efficiency. Three methods are mainly recognized for its assessment. Two of them based on standardized methodologies, face the problem by considering the indoor environment in steady-state conditions ({PMV} and {PPD}) and users as active subjects whose thermal perception is influenced by outdoor climatic conditions (adaptive approach). The latter method is the starting point to investigate thermal comfort from an overall perspective by considering endogenous variables besides the traditional physical and environmental ones. Following this perspective, the paper describes the results of an in-field investigation of thermal conditions through the use of nearable and wearable solutions, parametric models and machine learning techniques. The aim of the research is the exploration of the reliability of {IoT}-based solutions combined with advanced algorithms, in order to create a replicable framework for the assessment and improvement of user thermal satisfaction. For this purpose, an experimental test in real offices was carried out involving eight workers. Parametric models are applied for the assessment of thermal comfort; {IoT} solutions are used to monitor the environmental variables and the users\&rsquo; parameters; the machine learning {CART} method allows to predict the users\&rsquo; profile and the thermal comfort perception respect to the indoor environment.},

However, several studies have demonstrated that this conventional practice is unlikely to meet the thermal requirements of occupants in a single or multi-occupancy space due to occupants' diverse preferences, activities and needs. To improve occupants' thermal comfort, this study develops and tests a smartphone application framework which is capable of dynamically determining the optimum room conditioning mode (mechanical conditioning or natural ventilation) and {HVAC} settings (thermostat setpoint) in single and multi-occupancy spaces. The “personalized” {HVAC} control framework integrates environment data (obtained from sensors) with human physiological and behavioral data (obtained from wearable devices, polling apps) in a smartphone application we developed for human-building interaction. In the operation phase, occupants' thermal preferences are continuously predicted using the personalized comfort models, developed from the training data through the Random Forest classifier, when determining the optimum {HVAC} control strategies. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed framework to improve thermal comfort in single and multi-occupancy spaces.},

We developed personal thermal comfort models using lab grade wearable in normal daily activities. We collected physiological signals (e.g., skin temperature, heart rate) of 14 subjects (6 female and 8 male adults) and environmental parameters (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity) for 2–4 weeks (at least 20 h per day). Then we trained 14 models for each subject with different machine-learning algorithms to predict their thermal preference. The results show that the median prediction power could be up to 24\%/78\%/0.79 (Cohen's kappa/accuracy/{AUC}) with all features considered. The median prediction power reaches 21\%/71\%/0.7 after 200 subjective votes. We explored the importance of different features on the prediction performance by considering all subjects in one dataset. When all features included for the entire dataset, personal comfort models can generate the highest performance of 35\%/76\%/0.80 by the most predictive algorithm. Personal comfort models display the highest prediction power when occupants' thermal sensations is outside thermal neutrality. Skin temperature measured at the ankle is more predictive than measured at the wrist. We suggest that Cohen's kappa or {AUC} should be employed to assess the performance of personal thermal comfort models for imbalanced datasets due to the capacity to exclude random success.},

	abstract = {{HVAC} systems are the major energy consumers in commercial buildings in the United States. These systems are operated to provide comfortable thermal conditions for building occupants. The common practice of defining operational settings for {HVAC} systems is to use fixed set points, which assume occupants have static comfort requirements. However, thermal comfort has been shown to vary from person to person and also change over time due to climatic variations or acclimation. In this paper, we introduce an online learning approach for modeling and quantifying personalized thermal comfort. In this approach, we fit a probability distribution to each comfort condition (i.e., uncomfortably warm, comfortable, and uncomfortably cool) data set and define the overall comfort of an individual through combing these distributions in a Bayesian network. In order to identify comfort variations over time, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is used on the joint probability distributions. In order to identify comfortable environmental conditions, a Bayesian optimal classifier is trained using online learning. In order to validate the approach, we collected data from 33 subjects, and an average accuracy of 70.14\% and specificity of 76.74\% were achieved. In practice, this approach could transform the comfort objectives to constrain functions and prevents pareto optimality problems.},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort is a personal assessment of one's satisfaction with the surroundings. Yet, most thermal comfort delivery mechanisms preclude physiological and psychological precursors to thermal comfort. Accordingly, many people feel either cold or hot in an environment that is supposedly thermally comfortable to most people. To address this issue, this paper proposes to use people's heart rate variability ({HRV}) as an alternative indicator of thermal comfort. Since {HRV} is linked to homeostasis, we hypothesize that it could be used to predict people's thermal comfort status. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed statistical, spectral, and nonlinear {HRV} indices of 17 human subjects doing light office work in a cold, a neutral, and a hot environment. The resulting {HRV} indices were used as inputs to machine learning classification algorithms. We observed that {HRV} is distinctively altered depending on the thermal environment and that it is possible to steadfastly predict each subject's thermal environment (cold, neutral, and hot) with up to a 93.7\% prediction accuracy. The result of this study implies that it could be possible to design automatic real-time thermal comfort controllers based on people's {HRV}.},

However, securing consistent occupant feedback for model development is challenging as the current methods of data collection rely on individuals' survey participation. We explored the use of a new type of feedback, occupants' heating and cooling behavior with a personal comfort system ({PCS}) for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals' thermal preference. The model development draws from field data including {PCS} control behavior, environmental conditions and mechanical system settings collected from 38 occupants in an office building, and employs six machine learning algorithms. The results showed that (1) personal comfort models based on all field data produced the median accuracy of 0.73 among all subjects and improved predictive accuracy compared to conventional models ({PMV}, adaptive) which produced a median accuracy of 0.51; (2) the {PMV} and adaptive models produced individual comfort predictions only slightly better than random guessing under the relatively mild indoor environment observed in the field study; and (3) the models based on {PCS} control behavior produced the best prediction accuracy when individually assessing all categories of field data acquired in the study. We conclude that personal comfort models based on occupants' heating and cooling behavior can effectively predict individuals' thermal preference and can therefore be used in everyday comfort management to improve occupant satisfaction and energy use in buildings.},

	abstract = {To assess whether school environments can adversely affect academic performance, we review scientific evidence relating indoor pollutants and thermal conditions, in schools or other indoor environments, to human performance or attendance. We critically review evidence for direct associations between these aspects of indoor environmental quality ({IEQ}) and performance or attendance. Secondarily, we summarize, without critique, evidence on indirect connections potentially linking {IEQ} to performance or attendance. Regarding direct associations, little strongly designed research was available. Persuasive evidence links higher indoor concentrations of {NO}(2) to reduced school attendance, and suggestive evidence links low ventilation rates to reduced performance. Regarding indirect associations, many studies link indoor dampness and microbiologic pollutants (primarily in homes) to asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections, which in turn have been related to reduced performance and attendance. Also, much evidence links poor {IEQ} (e.g. low ventilation rate, excess moisture, or formaldehyde) with adverse health effects in children and adults and documents dampness problems and inadequate ventilation as common in schools. Overall, evidence suggests that poor {IEQ} in schools is common and adversely influences the performance and attendance of students, primarily through health effects from indoor pollutants. Evidence is available to justify (i) immediate actions to assess and improve {IEQ} in schools and (ii) focused research to guide {IEQ} improvements in schools.
{PRACTICAL} {IMPLICATIONS}: There is more justification now for improving {IEQ} in schools to reduce health risks to students than to reduce performance or attendance risks. However, as {IEQ}-performance links are likely to operate largely through effects of {IEQ} on health, {IEQ} improvements that benefit the health of students are likely to have performance and attendance benefits as well. Immediate actions are warranted in schools to prevent dampness problems, inadequate ventilation, and excess indoor exposures to substances such as {NO}(2) and formaldehyde. Also, siting of new schools in areas with lower outdoor pollutant levels is preferable.},

There is growing evidence to show that associations between perceived productivity and clusters of factors such as comfort, health and satisfaction of staff. Some of the management, design and use characteristics which contribute towards better energy efficiency also help productivity, thereby helping to close the loop on a potential ‘virtuous’ circle. Unfortunately, the vast majority of occupied buildings do not have these self-reinforcing qualities and many are unmanageably complex. This paper examines which factors within the control of building designers and managers best contribute to human productivity - the ‘killer’ variables of the title. L'étude, la gestion et l'utilisation de l'environnement intérieur peuvent être á l'origine de pertes ou de gains pouvant atteindre 15\% de la rotation du personnel d'une organisation administrative. Il apparaít de plus en plus qu'il existe des liens entre la productivité perçue et des groupes de facteurs tels que le confort, l'hygiène et la satisfaction du personnel. Quelques unes des caractéristiques de gestion, de conception et d'utilisation qui contribuent à un meilleur rendement énergétique sont également benéfiques pour la productivité, ce qui permet de fermer la boucle d'un cercle vertueux potentiel. Malheureusement, la grande majorité des bâtiments occupés ne possèdent pas ces qualités d'autorenforcement et dans de nombreux cas, sont impossibles à gérer de par leur complexité.

	abstract = {Comfort and well-being are complex and dynamic social and cultural constructs that are laden with different meanings related to different spheres of everyday life (e.g. home, work, leisure, study). Building design frameworks have reduced these concepts to measurable parameters, such as thermal neutrality, but accumulating evidence shows this to be unsupportive of wider occupant, organizational or environmental needs. This supports calls for more adaptive standards and personal control to account for variation in human perceptions of comfort and well-being. Understanding of the socio-technical dynamics of comfort and well-being as they are negotiated and experienced in the different settings of everyday life is another relatively unexplored area of academic debate. This article reviews these different understandings of comfort and well-being and the approaches to intelligent and sustainable building practice they inspire. In conclusion, the benefits of focusing on comfort and well-being as products of socio-technical systems are discussed.},

Participants performed computerized neurobehavioral tests during exposure in the lab; their physiological parameters including heart rate variation ({HRV}) and electroencephalograph ({EEG}) were also measured. Several subjective rating scales were used to tap participant’s emotion, well-being, motivation and the workload imposed by tasks. It was found that the warm discomfort negatively affected participants’ well-being and increased the ratio of low frequency ({LF}) to high frequency ({HF}) of {HRV}. In the moderately uncomfortable environment, the workload imposed by tasks increased and participants had to exert more effort to maintain their performance and they also had lower motivation to do work. The results indicate that thermal discomfort caused by high or low air temperature had negative influence on office workers’ productivity and the subjective rating scales were useful supplements of neurobehavioral performance measures when evaluating the effects of {IEQ} on productivity.},

To enable building professionals to select of building designs and operating practices that account for effects on health and productivity, we need models for quantifying the health and productivity benefits of better indoor environments. Therefore, we have reviewed the literature on the effects of indoor environment on health and performance and used existing data, when possible, to develop some initial models.

A quantitative relationship was established between thermal sensation votes and task performance.

The relationship indicates that optimum performance can be achieved slightly below neutral, while thermal discomfort (feeling too warm or too cold) leads to reduced performance.

It examines different methods for measuring thermal comfort, such as air temperature measurement, assessing residents' perception, and predicting satisfaction. Resident's perception was used effectively in the {WHO} {LARES} project, showing that self-reported poor health was significantly associated with poor thermal comfort. Tools to inform strategies directed at dealing with cold homes and fuel poverty are considered, including Energy Performance Certificates, Fuel Poverty Indicators, and the English Housing Health and Safety Rating System. Conclusions from a {WHO} Workshop on Housing, Energy and Thermal Comfort are also summarised. The {WHO} view of thermal comfort, which is driven by protecting health from both high and low indoor temperatures, should be recognised in energy efficiency, fuel poverty and climate change strategies. While this is a major challenge, it could provide both health gains for individuals, and economic benefits for society.},

This paper discusses two implementations of the adaptive comfort model in terms of usability and energy use for moderate maritime climate zones by means of literature study, a case study comprising temperature measurements, and building performance simulation. It is concluded that for moderate climate zones the adaptive model is only applicable during summer months, and can reduce energy for naturally conditioned buildings. However, the adaptive thermal comfort model has very limited application potential for such climates. Additionally we suggest a temperature parameter with a gradual course to replace the mean monthly outdoor air temperature to avoid step changes in optimum comfort temperatures.},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort models - specifically the J.B. Pierce two-node model of human thermoregulation and the Fanger Comfort Equation - predict comfort responses of individuals exposed to thermal environments under conditions of either rest or exercise. This paper evaluates the ability of these two models to predict the physiological variables underlying thermal comfort over a wide range of still air environments (effective temperature between 5°C and 45°C) and exercise intensities (rest to 85\% of maximal aerobic capacity). The physiological data base used for comparison was taken from several published and as-yet unpublished studies at three different laboratories. Values of core temperature ({TCR}), skin temperature ({TSK}) and skin wettedness predicted by the Pierce two-node model, and {PMV}, predicted by the Fanger model, differed significantly from observed values (P{\textless}.05). The Pierce model tended to underestimate w (mean error = -.16) and {TCR} (mean error = -.31°C), and to overpredict {TSK} (mean error = .48°C). wettedness predictions were less accurate for high exercise intensity (6 to 8 met) than for rest, low exercise intensity (i to 3.5 met) or moderate exercise intensity (3.5 to 6 met). Accuracy was higher for males than females, and greater for females in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle than females in the luteal phase. Errors in {TSK} predictions were also associated with exercise intensity but not associated with either gender or effective temperature. {TCR} predictions were significantly more accurate for females than for males. The average error associated with {PMV} predictions was 1.26 scaling units and was related to both effective temperature ({ET}*) and exercise intensity. Based on multiple linear regression with and exercise intensity, the expected error in {PMV} was approximately zero at {ET}=28°C for resting subjects. The magnitude of error increased by approximately .3 scaling units for each l°C change in {ET}, and by approximately 1.3 scaling units for each increase in exercise intensity level (e.g. rest to low).},

	abstract = {As people spend most of their time indoors, steady state models may be appropriate for thermal comfort assessments there, while, for the relatively short times spent outdoors (mostly less than 1h), those models tend to overestimate discomfort. This discrepancy is larger for cool outdoor conditions than for warm ones. For example, for a person leaving a room in thermal comfort (Tsk=33.5°C, Tcore=37 °C) into cold winter outdoor conditions (Ta=Tmrt=0°C, {VP}=5hPa, v=1m/s) obtaining steady state will take many hours, while leaving into hot conditions (Ta=30°C, Tmrt=60°C, {VP}=15hPa, v=0.5m/s) it will be reached within less than 30min. Consequently, especially for outdoor thermal comfort assessments in cold conditions, non-steady state models should be applied. This, among other new aspects, will be considered in a new internationally standardised Universal Thermal Climate Index ({UTCI}), which is currently being developed by a working group of the International Society of Biometeorology. Besides such physical/physiological approaches, psychological factors also have to be considered, i.e. diverging thermal expectations indoors and outdoors. Consequently, different approaches are necessary for assessing indoor or outdoor thermal comfort.},

However, not until the progress in modern statistics, physics and physiology in the course of this century provided quantitative methods did human-biometeorology become an acknowledged natural science. In the first half of this century primarily the explanation of the phenomena of reactions of the body to weather changes was the general objective. In the second half of this century quantitative descriptions of thermal interchanges between the human body and the environment by means of energy balance models of the human body have gained increasing importance. The methods of modern human biometeorology increasingly are acknowledged by workers in disciplines of potential application, such as urban or regional planners or air conditioning engineers. Human biometeorology tries to assess all atmospheric influences in its entierty, including the air pollution pattern. The discipline considers itself as branch of science which is tied closely to environmental meteorology and environmental medicine.},

	abstract = {In recent years, adaptive thermal comfort models have been integrated into several building design and operations regulatory documents. Although the theoretical background of the adaptive thermal comfort models is quite mature, still some ambiguities exist for their application. The objective of this study is to identify the main sources of uncertainty around application of adaptive models and to analyze quantitatively the difference between the adaptive comfort models proposed by the regulatory documents when applied across a spectrum of different climate zones. This paper analyzes the adaptive models in {ASHRAE} Standard 55, the European {EN} 15251 (and its revision {prEN} 16798), the Dutch {ISSO} 74 and the Chinese {GB}/T 50785. For each regulatory document, the major variations or sources of uncertainty are investigated: for {ASHRAE} 55, the length of the calculation period of the prevailing mean of outdoor temperature, and for {EN} 15251, {prEN} 16798, and {GB}/T 50785, the exponential decay weighting factors used in the calculation of the running mean outdoor temperature. This study shows that, although these regulatory documents have promoted the uptake of adaptive comfort models by practitioners and designers, uncertainties surrounding their application obstruct full exploitation. In response, this paper offers a fine-tuning of some of the adaptive comfort models. However, the issue of adaptive models' applicability in hybrid ventilation or mixed-mode buildings is still to be resolved, as is a rational basis for identifying the operational mode of such buildings when the adaptive models can be applied, because of their intermittent compliance during transition seasons and also extreme weather events.},

	abstract = {Energy consumption of residential buildings and offices adds up to about 30\% of total carbon dioxide emissions; and occupant behaviour contributes to 80\% of the variation in energy consumption1. Indoor climate regulations are based on an empirical thermal comfort model that was developed in the 1960s (ref. 2). Standard values for one of its primary variables—metabolic rate—are based on an average male, and may overestimate female metabolic rate by up to 35\% (ref. 3). This may cause buildings to be intrinsically non-energy-efficient in providing comfort to females. Therefore, we make a case to use actual metabolic rates. Moreover, with a biophysical analysis we illustrate the effect of miscalculating metabolic rate on female thermal demand. The approach is fundamentally different from current empirical thermal comfort models and builds up predictions from the physical and physiological constraints, rather than statistical association to thermal comfort. It provides a substantiation of the thermal comfort standard on the population level and adds flexibility to predict thermal demand of subpopulations and individuals. Ultimately, an accurate representation of thermal demand of all occupants leads to actual energy consumption predictions and real energy savings of buildings that are designed and operated by the buildings services community.},

The exercise began with a systematic collection and harmonization of raw data from the last two decades of thermal comfort field studies around the world. The {ASHRAE} Global Thermal Comfort Database {II} (Comfort Database), now an online, open-source database, includes approximately 81,846 complete sets of objective indoor climatic observations with accompanying “right-here-right-now” subjective evaluations by the building occupants who were exposed to them. The database is intended to support diverse inquiries about thermal comfort in field settings. A simple web-based interface to the database enables filtering on multiple criteria, including building typology, occupancy type, subjects' demographic variables, subjective thermal comfort states, indoor thermal environmental criteria, calculated comfort indices, environmental control criteria and outdoor meteorological information. Furthermore, a web-based interactive thermal comfort visualization tool has been developed that allows end-users to quickly and interactively explore the data.},

The objective of this work is to investigate the relationship between various contextual factors and the perception of thermal comfort in workplaces, by examining the gap between the current thermal comfort criteria and the actual requirements observed for different groups of occupants. The classic thermal comfort field research design i.e. simultaneous measurements of physical environmental parameters and questionnaire surveys, was implemented for two years in both centralised {HVAC} and mixed-mode office buildings located in Southern Brazil. Over 7500 questionnaires were completed by occupants of the buildings. Key variables including the participants' gender, age, body mass index, prior exposure to air-conditioning and building ventilation type were investigated in order to identify their association with thermal discomfort in the office workplace. Our results suggest that males, overweight occupants and those who are more frequently exposed to air-conditioning are more likely to express thermal discomfort due to feeling ‘warm’, compared to females, non-overweight occupants and those who were exposed to air-conditioning less frequently. In comparison, females, non-overweight occupants, air-conditioning light users, and occupants of centralised {HVAC} buildings were more likely to declare ‘cold’ discomfort. We also investigated how those variables were related to the width of thermal comfort zone. The analysis indicates that different groups of occupants require different comfort zones, suggesting that group differences should be considered when designing/operating spaces for diverse groups of occupants.},

Thus, 116 field studies were performed from March 2014 to March 2016 involving 584 participants in two office buildings. In order to collect temperature, relative humidity and air velocity data, microclimate stations were installed in the offices. Data collected were submitted to statistical analysis: they were initially separated according to the type of building (mixed-mode or fully air-conditioned) and operating system, and then they were distributed according to gender. The comfort temperatures were estimated by means of linear regression and by using the Griffiths method. Results show that the Griffiths method is more suitable to express the comfort temperature for men and women. Overall, the comfort temperature was 24.0 °C for females, and 23.2 °C for males. In the mixed-mode building, comfort temperature was statistically higher for females than that for males (23.7 °C and 23.0 °C, respectively). In the fully air-conditioned building, significant differences were found for comfort temperature for females and males (24.2 °C and 23.4 °C, respectively). Furthermore, when the mixed-mode building operated under natural ventilation the comfort temperatures tended to be lower for both men and women when compared to the comfort temperature found in the same building during air-conditioning operation.},

There exist, however, underlying biases in relation to all contributing variables, and a further bias related to the outdoor temperature. These biases often combine to produce a substantial bias in {PMV}. In surveys of individual buildings, {PMV} often differs markedly and systematically from the actual mean vote, both for naturally ventilated ({NV}) and for air-conditioned ({AC}) spaces. Possible origins of the biases are discussed, and it is shown that it would be possible to modify {PMV} substantially to reduce them. Environmental consequences of the use of {PMV} are discussed.

Significant correlations were detected between {UTCI} and other heat indices ({SET}, {PET}, {PMV}, and {WBGT}). {UTCI} also was measurably correlated with environmental parameters like dry temperature (P {\textless} 0.0001). The highest correlation coefficient was observed between {UTCI} and {PET} (r = 0.96). {UTCI} also had strong correlations with {WBGT} (r = 0.88), {SET} (r = 0.87), and dry temperature (r = 0.90). Thus, indices that are calculated based on body thermal equation (i.e. {SET} and {PET}) are more strongly connected with {UTCI}, registering a better slope. On the other hand, {WBGT} is more similar to {UTCI} (than other indices) in terms of thermal perception.},

The air temperature (Ta) was set at either 20 degrees C or 40 degrees C at commencement. The subject was directed to adjust the Ta for 45 min by manipulating a remote control switch to the level at which he felt most comfortable. In the older group, the Tpref was significantly lower in trails starting at 20 degrees C than that starting at 40 degrees C in summer. The fluctuation of Tpref (temperature difference between maximum and minimum Ta during the last 10 min) was significantly wider in the older group in both summer and winter. Repetition of the same experiment on each subject showed a poorer reproducibility of Tpref in the older group than in the younger group in summer. Tympanic and esophageal temperatures of the older group kept falling throughout the trial starting at 20 degrees C in summer. These results suggest that thermal sensitivity is decreased with advancing age and that thermal perception in the elderly, especially to cold, is less sensitive in summer.},

	abstract = {In the assessment of thermal comfort in buildings, the use of the Predicted Mean Vote ({PMV}) model is very popular. For this model, data on the climate, on clothing and on metabolic heat production are required. This paper discusses the representation and measurement of clothing parameters and metabolic rate in the {PMV} context. Several problems are identified and for some of these solutions are provided. For clothing insulation it was shown that effects of body motion and air movement are so big that they must be accounted for in comfort prediction models to be physically accurate. However, effects on dry heat exchange are small for stationary, light work at low air movement. Also algorithms for convective heat exchange in prediction models should be reconsidered. For evaporative heat resistance of the clothing worn, which is currently not an input factor in the {PMV} model, it was shown that in cases where special clothing with high vapour resistance is worn (e.g. clean-room clothing), comfort may be limited by the clothing as it will induce a high skin wettedness. Thus, for such cases clothing vapour resistance should not be neglected in the calculation of comfort using the {PMV} model, or the induced skin wettedness should be calculated separately. The effects on thermal comfort of reductions in vapour resistance due to air and body movements are also shown to have a substantial impact on the comfort limits in terms of skin wettedness and cannot be neglected either. For metabolic heat production it was concluded that for precise comfort assessment a precise measure of metabolic rate is needed. In order to improve metabolic rate estimation based on {ISO} 8996, more data and detail is needed for activities with a metabolic rate below 2 {MET}. Finally, it was shown that the methods for determining metabolic rate provided in {ISO} 8996 (typically used in comfort assessment and evaluations) do not provide sufficient accuracy to allow determination of comfort (expressed as {PMV}) in sufficient precision to classify buildings to within 0.3 {PMV} units as proposed in the upcoming revision of {ISO} 7730.},

It leverages the Internet of Things and machine learning to learn individuals' comfort requirements directly from the data collected in their everyday environment. Its results could be aggregated to predict comfort of a population. To provide guidance on future efforts in this emerging research area, this paper presents a unified framework for personal comfort models. We first define the problem by providing a brief discussion of existing thermal comfort models and their limitations for real-world applications, and then review the current state of research on personal comfort models including a summary of key advances and gaps. We then describe a modeling framework to establish fundamental concepts and methodologies for developing and evaluating personal comfort models, followed by a discussion of how such models can be integrated into indoor environmental controls. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for applications of personal comfort models for building design, control, standards, and future research.},

	abstract = {Dans la présente analyse, nous avons évalué la validité de deux modèles de confort thermiques couramment utilisés. Le premier, le modèle de Fanger de vote moyen prévisible (indice {PMV}), combine quatre variables physiques (température de l'air, vitesse de l'air, température moyenne radiante et humidité relative) et deux variables personnelles (isolation par les vêtements et niveau d'activité) pour obtenir un indice qui peut servir à prédire la sensation thermique moyenne d'un grand groupe de personnes. Le second, le modèle de prédiction des courants d'air, prédit le pourcentage d'occupants qui pourrait se plaindre de courants d'air localisés à partir de trois variables physiques (température de l'air, vitesse moyenne de l'air et intensité de la turbulence). Notre analyse a indiqué que le modèle {PMV} n'est pas toujours un bon prédicteur de la sensation thermique réelle, en particulier dans le cadre des études sur le terrain. Les divergences entre les sensations thermiques prédites et réelles traduisaient en partie les difficultés liées à l'obtention de mesures précises pour l'isolation par les vêtements et le niveau d'activité. Dans la pratique, une mauvaise estimation de ces deux variables tend à réduire la précision des prédictions {PMV}. Notre analyse a également fait ressortir que l'erreur systématique des prédictions {PMV} variait selon le contexte. Le modèle générait de meilleures prédictions dans les bâtiments climatisés que dans ceux qui recevaient une ventilation naturelle, en partie à cause de l'influence de la température de l'air extérieur et des possibilités d'adaptation.},

	abstract = {Designing and constructing near zero energy buildings ({NZEBs}) is a challenge not only from a structural point of view, but also from the point of view of ensuring appropriate climate comfort for users. The standards describing how to ensure comfort were created in times when the challenges of building {ZEB}/{NZEB} were not yet explored and energy issues were not as important as they are today. Therefore, the assessment of the thermal and climatic comfort of people living and working in such buildings requires a new or revised approach to the methodology of thermal comfort assessment. In this article, the authors present the results of a thermal comfort study based on measurements and thermal sensory tests. Testing was carried out in an experimental oﬃce building (passive standard). The main goal of the experiment was to compare the thermal comfort measurement method based on the {ISO}-Fanger model with the actual comfort results obtained by the panellists in the model oﬃce condition. The tests allowed the lowest operating temperature providing thermal comfort (predicted mean vote ({PMV}) = 0 and −0.5) to be determined. Sensory tests were conducted using three types of questions. The results were compared to the other researchers’ ﬁndings. It was noted that the panellists showed better thermal comfort sensation at lower temperatures than would result from the traditional Fanger distribution, so the authors proposed the experimental function of percentage of dissatisﬁed ({PPD}) = f({PMV}). The authors hope that it contributed to the actual state of knowledge as a “small and speciﬁc scale” validation of the existing thermal comfort model. The results also revealed that the method of heating has an inﬂuence on the subjective thermal sensation.},

In this paper, an approach is introduced for verifying compliance with energy performance criteria of residential buildings. The approach is based on a performance gap analysis that takes the uncertainties in the energy evaluation methods into consideration. The scope is to verify building energy performance through simulation and analysis of measured data, identifying any performance gap due to deviations from the intended design or flaws in the finished building based on performance gap analysis. In the approach, a simulation model is calibrated to match the heat loss coefficient of the building envelope [{kWh}/K] instead of the measured energy. The introduced approach is illustrated using a single-family residential building. The heat loss coefficient was found useful towards identifying any deviations from the intended design or flaws in the finished building. The case study indicated that the method uncertainty was important to consider in the performance gap analysis and that the proposed approach is applicable even when the performance gap appears to be non-existing.},

	abstract = {An ingestible telemetric temperature sensor for measuring body core temperature (Tc) was first described 45 years ago, although the method has only recently gained widespread use for exercise applications. This review aims to (1) use Bland and Altman's limits of agreement (LoA) method as a basis for quantitatively reviewing the agreement between intestinal sensor temperature (Tintestinal), oesophageal temperature (Toesophageal) and rectal temperature (Trectal) across numerous previously published validation studies; (2) review factors that may affect agreement; and (3) review the application of this technology in field-based exercise studies. The agreement between Tintestinal and Toesophageal is suggested to meet our delimitation for an acceptable level of agreement (ie, systematic bias {\textless}0.1 degrees C and 95\% LoA within +/-0.4 degrees C). The agreement between Tintestinal and Trectal shows a significant systematic bias {\textgreater}0.1 degrees C, although the 95\% LoA is acceptable. Tintestinal responds less rapidly than Toesophageal at the start or cessation of exercise or to a change in exercise intensity, but more rapidly than Trectal. When using this technology, care should be taken to ensure adequate control over sensor calibration and data correction, timing of ingestion and electromagnetic interference. The ingestible sensor has been applied successfully in numerous sport and occupational applications such as the continuous measurement of Tc in deep sea saturation divers, distance runners and soldiers undertaking sustained military training exercises. It is concluded that the ingestible telemetric temperature sensor represents a valid index of Tc and shows excellent utility for ambulatory field-based applications.},

	abstract = {Accurately assessing the physiological status of firefighters during work in the heat is critical to ensuring their safety. Evaluating core temperatures (Tc) in the field is problematic due to cost and limitations in technology and accuracy. As such, fire services rely on individual perceptions of wellbeing. The present study aimed to establish whether perceptual responses measured using the perceptual strain index (PeSI), calculated from rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and thermal sensation (TS), could reliably predict the physiological strain (PSI) encountered by experienced firefighters working in a hot environment. We conducted two firefighting simulations (set-pace and self-paced) in a purposefully built heat chamber (100 ± 5°C) comprised of two 20-min periods separated by a 10-min recovery outside the chamber. Physiological strain was measured via heart rate (HR) and gastrointestinal temperature (Tgi) and compared with PeSI at 5-min intervals. To evaluate the predictive ability of the PeSI for PSI, mean differences and the 95\% limits of agreement (LOA) were established, along with correlation coefficients at each 5-min interval. Moderately significant correlations occurred in the second work bout of the self-paced trial only (10 min: r = 0.335, 15 min: r = 0.498, 20 min r = 0.439) with no other correlations observed at any other time during either trial or during the rest periods. Bland-Altman analysis revealed mean differences of −0.74 ± 2.70 (self-paced) and +0.04 ± 2.04 (set-paced) between PeSI and PSI with the 95\% LOA being −4.77 to 3.28 (self-paced) and −4.01 to 2.01 (set-paced). The wide LOA and lack of correlations observed between perceptual and physiological strain in both self-paced and set-paced work trials indicate that PeSI is not sufficiently reliable as a sole measure of wellbeing for firefighters working in the heat. Hence, we recommend that fire services prioritise the development of reliable and effective monitoring tools for use in the field.},

	abstract = {The main parameters evaluated with a conventional thermal response test (TRT) are the subsurface thermal conductivity surrounding the borehole and the effective borehole thermal resistance, when averaging the inlet and outlet temperature of a ground heat exchanger with the arithmetic mean. This effective resistance depends on two resistances: the 2D borehole resistance (Rb) and the 2D internal resistance (Ra) which is associated to the short-circuit effect between pipes in the borehole. This paper presents a ﬁeld method to evaluate these two components separately. Two approaches are proposed. In the ﬁrst case, the temperature at the bottom of the borehole is measured at the same time as the inlet and outlet temperatures as done in a conventional TRT. In the second case, different ﬂow rates are used during the experiment to infer the internal resistance. Both approaches assumed a predeﬁned temperature proﬁle inside the borehole. The methods were applied to real experimental tests and compared with numerical simulations. Interesting results were found by comparison with theoretical resistances calculated with the multipole method. The motivation for this work is evidenced by analyzing the impact of the internal resistance on a typical geothermal system design. It is shown to be important to know both resistance components to predict the variation of the effective resistance when the ﬂow rate and the height of the boreholes are changed during the design process.},

However, impact of local boundaries is still weakly studied in hilly urban historical layouts. Local microclimate variability and its influence on pedestrians’ comfort in selected hilly historical urban areas with varying local boundaries in term of vegetation, surface materials, urban density, and air quality, is investigated. To this aim, a field monitoring is carried out during summer in hilly dense built environment and numerical analysis is performed. Monitoring campaigns show how higher density and surface roughness in the urban historical area reduce daily temperature fluctuation up to 3°C, with higher night temperatures. Temperature discrepancies up to 5°C are detected compared to suburban greener area. Moreover, inverse correlation between sky-view factor and nighttime cooling is registered, with mean temperature variation up to 6.6°C. Numerical analysis shows different thermal comfort conditions within the same district, due to different local boundaries in terms of sky-view factor and surface materials properties. Maximum Predicted Mean Vote difference of 0.6 is detected in the same area. Findings demonstrate how impact of local boundaries needs to be accurately investigated, when analyzing quality of outdoor urban environment, to realistically predict citizens’ outdoor thermal conditions.},

The methods of exergy analysis, entropy generation minimization, and thermoeconomics are incorporated in an evolutionary manner.  This book is one of the few sources available that addresses the recommendations of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology for new courses in design engineering. Intended for classroom use as well as self-study, the text provides a review of fundamental concepts, extensive reference lists, end-of-chapter problem sets, helpful appendices, and a comprehensive case study that is followed throughout the text.  Contents include:  * Introduction to Thermal System Design  * Thermodynamics, Modeling, and Design Analysis  * Exergy Analysis  * Heat Transfer, Modeling, and Design Analysis  * Applications with Heat and Fluid Flow  * Applications with Thermodynamics and Heat and Fluid Flow  * Economic Analysis  * Thermoeconomic Analysis and Evaluation  * Thermoeconomic Optimization   Thermal Design and Optimization offers engineering students, practicing engineers, and technical managers a comprehensive and rigorous introduction to thermal system design and optimization from a distinctly contemporary perspective. Unlike traditional books that are largely oriented toward design analysis and components, this forward-thinking book aligns itself with an increasing number of active designers who believe that more effective, system-oriented design methods are needed.  Thermal Design and Optimization offers a lucid presentation of thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics as they are applied to the design of thermal systems. This book broadens the scope of engineering design by placing a strong emphasis on engineering economics, system simulation, and optimization techniques. Opening with a concise review of fundamentals, it develops design methods within a framework of industrial applications that gradually increase in complexity. These applications include, among others, power generation by large and small systems, and cryogenic systems for the manufacturing, chemical, and food processing industries.  This unique book draws on the best contemporary thinking about design and design methodology, including discussions of concurrent design and quality function deployment. Recent developments based on the second law of thermodynamics are also included, especially the use of exergy analysis, entropy generation minimization, and thermoeconomics. To demonstrate the application of important design principles introduced, a single case study involving the design of a cogeneration system is followed throughout the book.  In addition, Thermal Design and Optimization is one of the best new sources available for meeting the recommendations of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology for more design emphasis in engineering curricula.  Supported by extensive reference lists, end-of-chapter problem sets, and helpful appendices, this is a superb text for both the classroom and self-study, and for use in industrial design, development, and research.

The accuracy of these models depends on skin temperature prediction by thermophysiological models, which in turn rely on accurate environmental and personal input data. Environmental parameters are measured or prescribed, but personal factors such as clothing properties and metabolic rates have to be estimated. Data for estimating the overall values of clothing properties and metabolic rates are available in several papers and standards. However, local values are more difficult to retrieve. For local clothing, this study revealed that full and consistent data sets are not available in the published literature for typical office clothing sets. Furthermore, the values for local heat production were not verified for characteristic office activities, but were adapted empirically. Further analyses showed that variations in input parameters can lead to local skin temperature differences (∆Tskin,loc = 0.4–4.4°C). These differences can affect the local sensation output, where ∆Tskin,loc = 1°C is approximately one step on a 9-point thermal sensation scale. In conclusion, future research should include a systematic study of local clothing properties and the development of feasible methods for measuring and validating local heat production.},

With this increasing detail comes the need for anatomically specific convective and radiative heat transfer coefficients for the human body. The present study used an articulated thermal manikin with 16 body segments (head, chest, back, upper arms, forearms, hands, pelvis, upper legs, lower legs, feet) to generate radiative heat transfer coefficients as well as natural- and forced-mode convective coefficients. The tests were conducted across a range of wind speeds from still air to 5.0 m/s, representing atmospheric conditions typical of both indoors and outdoors. Both standing and seated postures were investigated, as were eight different wind azimuth angles. The radiative heat transfer coefficient measured for the whole-body was 4.5 W/m2 per K for both the seated and standing cases, closely matching the generally accepted whole-body value of 4.7 W/m2 per K. Similarly, the whole-body natural convection coefficient for the manikin fell within the mid-range of previously published values at 3.4 and 3.3 W/m2 per K when standing and seated respectively. In the forced convective regime, heat transfer coefficients were higher for hands, feet and peripheral limbs compared to the central torso region. Wind direction had little effect on convective heat transfers from individual body segments. A general-purpose forced convection equation suitable for application to both seated and standing postures indoors was hc=10.3v0.6 for the whole-body. Similar equations were generated for individual body segments in both seated and standing postures.},

These formed the basis for the equations used in 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU document, Energy and Protein Requirements. While Schoﬁeld’s analysis has served a signiﬁcant role in re-establishing the importance of using basal metabolic rate (BMR) to predict human energy requirements, recent workers have subsequently queried the universal validity and application of these equations. A survey of the most recent studies (1980 –2000) in BMR suggests that in most cases the current FAO/WHO/UNU predictive equations overestimate BMR in many communities. The FAO/WHO/UNU equations to predict BMR were developed using a database that contained a disproportionate number –3388 out of 7173 (47\%) – of Italian subjects. The Schoﬁeld database contained relatively few subjects from the tropical region. The objective here is to review the historical development in the measurement and application of BMR and to critically review the Schoﬁeld et al. BMR database presenting a series of new equations to predict BMR. Design: This division, while arbitrary, will enable readers who wish to omit the historical review of BMR to concentrate on the evolution of the new BMR equations. Setting: BMR data collected from published and measured values. Subjects: A series of new equations (Oxford equations) have been developed using a data set of 10 552 BMR values that (1) excluded all the Italian subjects and (2) included a much larger number (4018) of people from the tropics.
Results: In general, the Oxford equations tend to produce lower BMR values than the current FAO/WHO/UNU equations in 18–30 and 30 –60 year old males and in all females over 18 years of age.
Conclusions: This is an opportune moment to re-examine the role and place of BMR measurements in estimating total energy requirements today. The Oxford equations’ future use and application will surely depend on their ability to predict more accurately the BMR in contemporary populations.},

These formed the basis for the equations used in 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU document, Energy and Protein Requirements.While Schofield's analysis has served a significant role in re-establishing the importance of using basal metabolic rate (BMR) to predict human energy requirements, recent workers have subsequently queried the universal validity and application of these equations. A survey of the most recent studies (1980–2000) in BMR suggests that in most cases the current FAO/WHO/UNU predictive equations overestimate BMR in many communities. The FAO/WHO/UNU equations to predict BMR were developed using a database that contained a disproportionate number – 3388 out of 7173 (47\%) – of Italian subjects. The Schofield database contained relatively few subjects from the tropical region.The objective here is to review the historical development in the measurement and application of BMR and to critically review the Schofield et al. BMR database presenting a series of new equations to predict BMR.DesignThis division, while arbitrary, will enable readers who wish to omit the historical review of BMR to concentrate on the evolution of the new BMR equations.SettingBMR data collected from published and measured values.SubjectsA series of new equations (Oxford equations) have been developed using a data set of 10 552 BMR values that (1) excluded all the Italian subjects and (2) included a much larger number (4018) of people from the tropics.ResultsIn general, the Oxford equations tend to produce lower BMR values than the current FAO/WHO/UNU equations in 18–30 and 30–60 year old males and in all females over 18 years of age.ConclusionsThis is an opportune moment to re-examine the role and place of BMR measurements in estimating total energy requirements today. The Oxford equations' future use and application will surely depend on their ability to predict more accurately the BMR in contemporary populations.},

	abstract = {This review examines scientific literature on the effect of gender on indoor thermal comfort. Gender differences have been generally considered to be small and insignificant but this review shows that a growing number of studies have found significant differences in thermal comfort between the genders. Clearly more than half of the laboratory and field studies have found that females express more dissatisfaction than males in the same thermal environments. Very few studies have found males to be more dissatisfied than females. A meta-analysis shows that females are more likely than males to express thermal dissatisfaction (ratio: 1.74, 95\% confidence interval: 1.61–1.89). However, most studies found no significant difference in neutral temperatures between the genders. Females are more sensitive than males to a deviation from an optimal temperature and express more dissatisfaction, especially in cooler conditions. Practical Implications We should no longer neglect the more rigorous requirements that females have for indoor thermal environments. Gender differences indicate that females have, on average, a greater need for individual temperature control and adaptive actions than males. The results of this review suggest that females should primarily be used as subjects when examining indoor thermal comfort requirements, as if females are satisfied it is highly probable that males are also satisfied.},

Resting metabolic rate was also predicted using equations from the literature.Results: Resting metabolic rate (mean±s.d.) in normal weight subjects was 7983±1007 kJ/24 h (males) and 6127±907 kJ/24 h (females). Measured RMR and predicted RMR values using various equations from the literature were significantly different in males and females, except for the Harris–Benedict equation and the Schofield equations. Also, in overweight and obese subjects the prediction error was generally larger compared to normal-weight subjects for all formulas except for the Harris–Benedict and Schofield formulas. In overweight and obese males but not in females, RMR was lower than in normal-weight subjects after correcting for weight and age differences. Stepwise multiple regression of resting metabolic rate against weight, height and age in males and females did not reveal a prediction formula with a lower prediction error than the Harris–Benedict or Schofield formulas and thus was not further explored.Conclusions: The Harris–Benedict formula and the Schofield formula provide a valid estimation of resting metabolic rate at a group level in both normal-weight and overweight Italians. However, the individual error can be so high that for individual use a measured value has to be preferred over an estimated value.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001) 55, 208–214},

Body composition was determined by hydrodensitometry. 24EE was 124 +/- 38 kcal/d (P less than 0.002) higher in males than females after adjusting for differences in fat-free mass, fat mass, and age. Spontaneous physical activity was not significantly different between males and females. Since adjusted 24EE was 106 +/- 39 kcal/d (P less than 0.01) higher in females during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle compared with females during the follicular phase, energy expenditure was analyzed in a subset (greater than 50 yr) to minimize the confounding effect of menstrual status. 24EE (160 +/- 66 kcal/d; P less than 0.03), BMR (116 +/- 45; P less than 0.02), and SMR (208 +/- 68 kcal/d; P less than 0.005) were higher in males compared with females of the older subset after adjusting for differences in body composition, age, and activity.

Quantitative results for entropy generation were obtained as a function of age using the databases from the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which provide energy requirements and food intake composition as a function of age, weight and stature. Numerical integration was performed through human lifespan for different levels of physical activity. Results were presented and analyzed. Entropy generated over the lifespan of average individuals (natural death) was found to be 11,404 kJ/ºK per kg of body mass with a rate of generation three times higher on infants than on the elderly. The entropy generated predicts a life span of 73.78 and 81.61 years for the average U.S. male and female individuals respectively, which are values that closely match the average lifespan from statistics (74.63 and 80.36 years). From the analysis of the effect of different activity levels, it is shown that entropy generated increases with physical activity, suggesting that exercise should be kept to a “healthy minimum” if entropy generation is to be minimized.},

While closed systems eventually reach equilibria characterized by minimum Gibbs free energy and maximum entropy, Prigogine1 and de Groot2 have predicted that open systems will approach steady states of minimum entropy production. On this basis, Prigogine and Wiame3 have inferred that living organisms grow towards a state of minimum metabolism per unit mass, but this view and other discussions4 on this theme are subject to two criticisms. On one hand, the theorem of minimum entropy production holds only for open systems very near to the steady state5 and, on the other, it has never been tested experimentally for living organisms so that conclusions derived from it are weakened to some extent.},

In the present paper these conclusions are summarized and briefly discussed from a biological standpoint. It appears that the evolution of such systems is towards states with the least production of entropy (per mass unit) compatible with the conditions imposed. In the case of living matter this corresponds approximately to states of minimum metabolism. During this evolution the entropy contained in the system may decrease whilst the heterogenity increases. But this increase in heterogenity can only take place when there is a decrease in the entropy production, that is an evolution of the metabolism. We are thus led to suggest a physicochemical interpretation of Lamarchism. Finally we call attention to the fact that the moderation principle ofLe Chatelier-Braun is not limited to equilibrium states.},

One of the predictions of the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This is contrary to the static assumptions underlying the current ASHRAE comfort standard 55-92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55-92, the ASHRAE RP-884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21,000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static predicted means vote (PMV) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in HVAC buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation. These results formed the basis of a proposal for a variable indoor temperature standard.},

	abstract = {Finding the way to predict optimal thermal conditions for an ofﬁce worker would contribute to sustainable building design: the environmental effects would be reduced, the economics of the organization and whole society would improve and there would be indisputable social beneﬁts for the individual and the global community. These beneﬁts stem from the improved productivity of the ofﬁce worker in most favorable thermal environment and the possibilities to achieve this with lower energy demand. This study uses a new approach, exergy analysis, to recognise the optimal conditions by looking for the combination of mean radiant temperature and room air temperature giving the lowest human body exergy consumption rate. All of the commonly used thermal comfort prediction methods use energy analysis, and it seems that exergy analysis could give more accurate prediction of the conditions giving optimal thermal comfort. The new method is applied to the case of ofﬁce worker in typical and extreme weather conditions in Finland. The results agree well with the previous analyses, and moreover, the points giving minimum human body exergy consumption rate coincide with the points usually regarded as most comfortable in summer conditions. According to recent studies, people are also most productive at these conditions.},

	abstract = {Numerous metrics and indices have been proposed for the assessment of thermal perception and comfort. Commonly used indices based on the estimate of the heat ﬂow between the human and its environment includes the well-known Fanger's method, also known as the PMV-PPD thermal comfort model. Recently this thermodynamic approach has been expanded with the application of the second law of thermodynamics. In this paper, an exergy-based analysis of the relation between the human and its environment is presented. Heat and mass ﬂow rate due to convection, radiation, evaporation and respiration are calculated and expressed in terms of exergy loss. This value is used in the modiﬁed Fanger's thermal comfort model, where the heat balance equation is replaced by the exergy loss. The paper builds upon prior studies on determination of internal and external exergy losses by revised and newly deﬁned formulas taking into account clothing and indoor conditions. The results quantitatively show that thermal energy load in the original Fanger's PMV model could be substituted by exergy loss and it corresponds to a certain level of subjective assessed thermal comfort level.},

	abstract = {Exergy analysis offers the potential of minimizing energy resource depletion, and is useful for assisting building designers in choosing building and building service concepts. Exergy recognizes that the energy that is carried by substances can only be used ‘down ’ to the level that is given by the environment. Unlike energy, exergy is not subject to a conservation law. This paper presents an outline of an exergy analysis tool for buildings and building services, including a new graphic input interface being developed with the aim of enhancing its user-friendliness. The idea underlying this interface is that energy engineers and building designers may approach the same contents from different perspectives. The tool illustrates energy and exergy flows in a building, including energy conversion steps in the building and building services, and exergy dissipation via the building envelope as a result of heat transmission and ventilation. The main advantage of this tool is that it enables a designer to compare energy and exergy flows for different building and building service configurations, from primary energy conversion through to the heating system and building envelope. 1.},

	abstract = {The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is an effective measure for risk screening to prevent heat dISOrders. However, a heat risk evaluation by WBGT requires adjustments depending on the clothing. In this study, we proposed a new effective WBGT (WBGTeff*) for general vapor permeable clothing ensembles and vapor impermeable protective clothing that is applicable to occupants engaged in moderate intensity work with a metabolic heat production value of around 174W/m2. WBGTeff* enables the conversion of heat stress into the scale experienced by the occupant dressed in the basic clothing ensemble (work clothes) based on the heat balances for a human body. We confirmed that WBGTeff* was effective for expressing the critical thermal environments for the prescriptive zones for occupants wearing vapor impermeable protective clothing. Based on WBGTeff*, we succeeded in clarifying how the weights for natural wet bulb, globe, and air temperatures and the intercept changed depending on clothing properties and the surrounding environmental factors when heat stress is expressed by the weighted sum of natural wet bulb, globe, and air temperatures and the intercept. The weight of environmental temperatures (globe and air temperatures) for WBGTeff* for vapor impermeable protective clothing increased compared with that for general vapor permeable clothing, whereas that of the natural wet bulb temperature decreased. For WBGTeff* in outdoor conditions with a solar load, the weighting ratio of globe temperature increased and that of air temperature decreased with air velocity. Approximation equations of WBGTeff* were proposed for both general vapor permeable clothing ensembles and for vapor impermeable protective clothing.},

Direct heating the building in winter requires temperatures of 40°C. In summer, cooling the university building uses a climatic control adsorption unit, which requires a temperature of minimum 55°C. The drilled rocks of the 2500 m deep borehole have extremely low permeabilities and porosities less than 1\%. Their thermal conductivity varies between 2.2 W/(m·K) and 8.9 W/(m·K). The high values are related to the quartzite sandstones. The maximum temperature in the borehole is 85°C at 2500 m depth, which corresponds to a mean specific heat flow of 85 mW/m2–90 mW/m2. Results indicate that for a short period, the borehole may deliver the required temperature. But after a 20-year period of operation, temperatures are too low to drive the adsorption unit for cooling. In winter, however, the borehole heat exchanger may still supply the building with sufficient heat, with temperatures varying between 25 and 55°C and a circulation flow rate of 10 m3/h at maximum.},

Application of exergy principles in the context of energy supply systems may achieve a more efficient energy-supply chain and a rational use of energy in buildings. This paper presents the exergy-based operation optimization of a Distributed Energy System (DES) by considering the whole energy-supply chain from energy resources to user demands. The problem is challenging in view of the complicated interactions of devices and the modeling of exergy losses. To capture these complicated interactions, energy networks are established with exergy losses modeled at the conversion step. A multi-objective mixed integer programming problem is formulated. The problem is efficiently solved by the novel integration of the surrogate Lagrangian relaxation and branch-and-cut. The Pareto frontier, including the best possible trade-offs between the economic and exergetic objectives, is obtained by minimizing a weighted sum of the total energy cost and total exergy losses occurring in the energy conversion step. Results demonstrate that the use of high-quality energy resources is reduced by the reduction of exergy losses through the optimized operation of the energy-supply chain, leading to the sustainability of energy supply systems.},

Heating, cooling and lighting appliances in buildings account for more than one third of the world’s primary energy demand. In turn, building stock is a major contributor to energy-related environmental problems. There are great potentials, which can be obtained through a more efficient use of energy in buildings. An optimisation of the exergy flows in buildings and the related supply structures, similar to other thermodynamic systems such as power stations, can help in identifying the potential of increased efficiency in energy utilisation. Through analyses, it can be shown that calculations based on the energy conservation and primary energy concept alone are inadequate for gaining a full understanding of all important aspects of energy utilisation processes. The high potential for a further increase in the efficiency of; for example, boilers, can not be quantified by energy analysis- the energy efficiency is close to 100\%; however, this potential can be showed by using exergy analysis [1], the exergy efficiency of a common gas boiler is about},

In this study we discuss the use of a thermophysiological model in the built environment to assess thermal sensation. In the context of this work, the use of CFD to simulate the thermal environmental conditions around a human is analyzed. Experimental data from two independent studies, covering both genders, are used to validate three different, currently available, thermal sensation models: (1) the Predicted Mean Vote index (PMV), (2) the UC Berkeley thermal sensation model and (3) the EN-ISO 14505 standard. Use of such a model is required to link physiological responses to thermal sensation. In this study they have been evaluated for two different steady-state non-uniform thermal environments. The results confirm that the PMV is not capable of predicting whole body thermal sensation when local effects (local skin temperatures and thermal sensation) have a significant influence. The results furthermore indicate that the use of a thermophysiological model (ThermoSEM) in combination with the UC Berkeley model or EN-ISO 14505 standard seems to be promising regarding the prediction of thermal sensation of local body parts and overall thermal sensation under steady-state non-uniform environments. The advantage of using a thermophysiological model in combination with a thermal sensation model is that thermal comfort can be assessed on a more individualized level under complex, daily encountered, thermal environments where local effects play an important role. However, both thermal sensation models need more research before they can be used in daily building design practice.},

	abstract = {The performance of a 3D urban microclimate model (ENVI-met Version 3.1) is evaluated with data collected during mostly clear and calm conditions in a compact low-rise residential neighbourhood of tropical Singapore. Observations are obtained from seven canopy-layer air temperature, Ta, sensors at 2 m above ground, including a fully equipped microclimate station measuring mean radiant temperature, MRT, at 1.1 m above ground. The model is capable of capturing the spatial variability across all stations during most of the eight simulation days. Spatially-averaged Ta predictions are closer to the observations during wet (based on five simulation days) compared to dry (three days) periods. Daytime model performance for MRT is variable but peak values are well predicted. Systematic errors dominate most simulations. The present model evaluation metrics are smaller than reported in similar work, which is likely due to the more accurate determination of model input variables using locally measured soil relative humidity and leaf area density profiles. A modification to how the model calculates MRT also helps to improve its daytime performance. Finally, the model is used to predict the effect of five temperature mitigation/planning strategies. The varying results highlight the micro- and bioclimatic complexities inherent in a heterogeneous urban system, with no one scenario providing consistent cooling throughout both day- and nighttime. Overall the present results suggest that ENVI-met is a useful planning tool for assessing Ta and daytime extremes in outdoor thermal comfort, but the model requires detailed local information for proper initialization and awareness of its limitations.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces CityComfort+, a new method to simulate the spatial variation of the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) in dense urban areas. This method derives the Tmrt by modeling five components of radiation fluxes—direct solar radiation, diffuse solar radiation, reflected solar radiation, long-wave radiation from the atmosphere, and long-wave radiation from urban surfaces—each weighted by view factors. The novelty of CityComfort+ lies in a new algorithm to model surface temperature and associated long-wave radiation as well as the application of RADIANCE, a ray-tracing algorithm that can accurately simulate 3-D radiation fluxes in a complex urban space (Ward, et al, 1998). CityComfort+ was evaluated in field studies conducted in a dense urban courtyard (mean sky view factor of 0.4) in Boston, Massachusetts, USA under winter, spring, and summer (cold, warm, and hot) weather conditions. Simulation results yielded close agreement with measured Tmrt. Also, predicted mean surface temperature agreed well with the measurement data. A sensitivity test using CityComfort+ revealed that Tmrt on the study site will be mostly affected by the heat capacity and emissivity of surface material, not albedo. This study is subject to limitations from sensor accuracy and the thermal inertia of the grey ball thermometer, and the CityComfort+ method is still under development. The next step is to compare its performance with existing methods.},

A study has been carried out on the thermal stratification which is crucial to system design, energy efficient operation and comfort performance of UFAD systems with an aim of examining impact of mean radiant temperature (MRT) on thermal comfort. Clear elucidation of the benefit of UFAD systems has been shown by comparing it to the traditional overhead air distribution systems. Keeping the same level of comfortable environment in the occupied zone, UFAD systems require much higher temperature of supply air, which represents significant energy savings. The benefit of UFAD systems is more pronounced at the condition of high ceiling height building. Considerable discrepancies in thermal comfort are found on the assumption that air temperature rather than MRT is used for the evaluation of PMV. However, more rigorous analysis including the full radiation simulation does not show any significant difference in PMV distribution. The result of the full radiation simulations requires much longer simulation time but gives similar air temperature distribution and only slightly higher averaged temperature than present approaches.},

	abstract = {Due to the increased expectations on human thermal comfort in sleeping environments at a low energy consumption, task/ambient air condition system (TAC) can be the best air conditioning method when considering the immobility of a sleeping person. Previously, convection-based TAC systems for sleeping environments were developed, with an obvious inadequacy of cold-draft problem. Therefore, a new radiation-based TAC system (R-TAC) was previously developed and experimentally studied at a set of fixed design parameter for its radiant panel. Therefore, a follow-up numerical study on the effects of varying design/operating parameters of the radiant panel on indoor thermal comfort and energy saving performances has been carried out, and the study results reported in this paper. Firstly, a geometry model based on the experimental bedroom used in the previous experimental study, boundary conditions and numerical study cases are detailed. Secondly, the results of validating the numerical method using the previous experimental data are reported. Thirdly, the numerical results on indoor thermal comfort, energy saving and draft risk at different surface temperature and emissivity, area of the radiant panel, and the distance between the radiant panel and a bed are presented. The numerical results demonstrated that all the four design/operating parameters of the radiant panel can significantly affect thermal comfort and energy saving performances in the bedroom when using the R-TAC system: increasing surface temperature can lead to a higher PMV value and a higher EUC value; increasing surface emissivity and area of the radiant panel a lower PMV value and a lower EUC value; reducing the distance between the bed and the panel a lower PMV value and a higher EUC value. Finally, the DR values were at a very low level in all the study cases, indicating the cold draft problem encountered when using a convective heat transfer based TAC system for a sleeping environment can be effectively resolved when using the R-TAC system.},

This issue is particularly relevant for historical and monumental buildings, which currently represent a large part of the historic buildings stock in Europe. For such protected buildings most of the available retrofitting solutions are not feasible and alternatives have to be investigated to guarantee their usability potential. The purpose of this study is therefore to present a methodology to evaluate the potential of electric radiant panels as retrofitting solutions for historical and monumental buildings, focusing on thermal comfort and energy saving potential when compared with conventional fossil-fuel-based heating systems. In fact, the non-invasiveness and flexibility of electrical panels make them one of the few feasible solutions for protected buildings. An original methodology is developed to evaluate the performance of such localized heating systems; the methodology is based on a dynamic simulation model, calibrated with temperature measurements, which takes into account the geometry and technical characteristics of electrical radiant panels and allows different control strategies to be compared. The methodology is applied to a relevant Italian historical building. The results show that the panels, despite their well-known low-exergy efficiency, may become a viable and attractive solution for historical buildings without undermining their preservation requirements. Apart from significantly increasing thermal comfort, electric radiant panels may also allow annual heating energy savings up to 70\% for the selected building.},

Human subject experiments were conducted to assess the overall comfort sensation and local discomfort, and local skin temperatures were measured. Through thermal manikin experiments, we discovered a new method for the precise measurement of the local sensible heat loss in nonuniform thermal environments. The local sensible heat losses were measured by the use of a thermal manikin that had the same local skin temperatures as the human subjects. The experimental conditions consisted of the anterior–posterior, right–left, and up–down asymmetric thermal environments created by radiation panels. A total of 35 thermal environmental conditions were created ranging from 25.5 to 30.5°C for air temperature, from 11.5 to 44.5°C for surface temperature of radiation panels, from 40\% RH to 50\% RH for humidity, and less than 0.05m/s for inlet air velocity to the climatic chamber. The local skin temperature changed depending on the environmental thermal nonuniformity, even if the mean skin temperature remained almost the same. It is essential to use the skin temperature distribution as well as mean skin temperature for expressing thermal comfort in nonuniform environments. The local sensible heat loss changed depending on the environmental thermal nonuniformity, even if the mean sensible heat loss remained almost the same. The relationship between the local skin temperature and local sensible heat loss cannot be depicted by a simple line; instead, it varies depending on the environmental thermal nonuniformity. The local heat discomfort in the head area was dependent on both the local skin temperature and local sensible heat loss. However, the local cold discomfort in the foot area was related only to the local skin temperature.},

This work endeavours to scrutinise and summarise studies that examined human thermal and comfort perception to such variations in the indoor environment: spatial transients, non-uniformities, and temperature drifts. We also briefly discuss personalised comfort systems since they work on an occupant's micro-climate and create non-uniformities in the indoors. Perusal of works done on effect of non-thermal factors on thermal comfort, point to the need for synchronizing the overall indoor environment's quality – in terms of décor, air quality, lighting etc. – to improve occupant thermal comfort. Essence of the overall discussions come out to be that indoor thermal environment can be variable and still agreeable, implying existence of energy saving avenues, hitherto precluded from earnest consideration.},

The sun's direct radiation can be considered to be among these radiant sources. In these cases, the computation of the mean radiant temperature and, consequently, the evaluation of the thermal comfort conditions, require knowledge of the “project area factor”, fp, of the subject. Moreover, the fp parameters are also applicable to derivation of the shape factors between subjects and the surrounding surfaces. For a manual evaluation of the projected area factors, a well-known set of graphs is available. But, when using computerized procedures, the handling of graphs can lead to troublesome operations and could involve reading errors. To avoid problems, we have developed two simple polynomial algorithms, founded on earlier data, for the automatic calculation of the projected area factors of seated and standing persons. A validation of the algorithms is also reported through the paper, for selected cases.},

Existing guidelines make recommendations for properly selecting set points to reduce energy use, but there is little or no information regarding the actual achieved thermal comfort of the occupants. While dry-bulb air temperature measured at the thermostat location is sometimes a good proxy, there is less understanding of whether thermal comfort targets are actually met. In this direction, we have defined an experimental Simulation protocol involving two office buildings; the buildings have contrasting geometrical and construction characteristics, as well as different building services systems for meeting heating and cooling demands. A parametric analysis is performed for combinations of controlled variables and boundary conditions. In all cases, occupant thermal comfort is estimated using the Fanger index, as defined in ISO 7730. The results of the parametric study suggest that simple bounds on the dry-bulb air temperature are not sufficient to ensure comfort, and in many cases, more detailed considerations taking into account building characteristics, as well as the types of building heating and cooling services are required. The implication is that the calculation or estimation of detailed comfort indices, or even the use of personalised comfort models, is key towards a more human-centric approach to building design and operation.},

However, most of the energy simulations for green building certification, in India, are performed considering a constant Ta set-point in both core as well perimeter zones.

The method provides an accurate representation of the "diffuse" and "ambient" terms found in typical image synthesis algorithms. The phenomena of "color bleeding" from one surface to another, shading within shadow envelopes, and penumbras along shadow boundaries are accurately reproduced. Additional advantages result because computations are indepedent of viewer position. This allows the efficient rendering of multiple views of the same scene for dynamic sequences. Light sources can be modulated and object reflectivities can be changed, with minimal extra computation. The procedures extend the radiosity method beyond the bounds previously imposed.},

Owing to the complexity of the outdoor environment, there have only been a few attempts to understand the effect of the thermal environment on people's use of outdoor spaces. This paper therefore seeks to determine the relationship between the thermal environment, park use and behavioural patterns in an urban area of Sweden. The methods used include structured interviews, unobtrusive observations of the naturally occurring behaviour and simultaneous measurements of thermal comfort variables, i.e., air temperature, air humidity, wind speed and global radiation. The thermal environment is investigated through the mean radiant temperature (T mrt) and the predicted mean vote (PMV) index. The outcome is compared to the subjective behaviour and thermal sensation of the interviewees. It is found that the thermal environment, access and design are important factors in the use of the park. In order to continue to use the park when the thermal conditions become too cold or too hot for comfort, people improve their comfort conditions by modifying their clothing and by choosing the most supportive thermal opportunities available within the place. The study also shows that psychological aspects such as time of exposure, expectations, experience and perceived control may influence the subjective assessment. Comparison between the thermal sensation of the interviewees and the thermal sensation assessed by the PMV index indicates that steady-state models such as the PMV index may not be appropriate for the assessment of short-term outdoor thermal comfort, mainly because they are unable to analyse transient exposure.},

	abstract = {Abstract Thermal perceptions and preferences of individuals outdoors cannot be entirely explained by the energy balance of the human body. They are also affected by psychological and behavioural factors or the so?called thermal adaptation. To examine the effect of thermal adaptation on seasonal outdoor thermal comfort, 1644 interviews with concurrent micrometeorological measurements were conducted outdoors in central Taiwan. Results indicate a deviation of 1.3 °C standard effective temperature (SET*) in neutral temperatures between hot and cool seasons, and a deviation of 1.8 °C SET* in preferred temperature between hot and cool seasons. Additionally, although subjects' temperature and sunshine preferences were highly correlated with SET*, they diverged between seasons for identical SET* exposures in the two seasons. Analysis reveals that people's thermal perceptions were strongly related to the air temperature (Ta) and mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), but not significant to air speed and air humidity. These results demonstrate that thermal adaptation markedly influences seasonal outdoor thermal comfort, knowledge of which may be useful in the planning and design of outdoor environments in hot?humid regions.

Thermal adaptation, which involves physiological, psychological and behavioral factors, also plays an important role in assessment of thermal environments by users. Given that these issues have rarely been addressed for outdoor environments in hot and humid regions, this study examines user thermal comfort in a public square in Taiwan. Physical measurements were taken and a questionnaire survey was used to assess the thermal comfort of subjects. The number of people visiting the square was also counted. Analytical results indicate that the thermal comfort range and neutral temperature of subjects was higher than those of people in a temperate region. Additionally, local subjects preferred a cool temperature and weak sunlight, and adapted to thermal environments by seeking shelter outdoors. Analytical results confirm the existence of thermal adaptation and illustrate the characteristics of, and variances in, thermal adaptation. During the cool season, the number of people visiting the square increased as the thermal index value increased. However, the number of people frequenting the square decreased as the thermal index increased during the hot season. These experimental results were compared with those for temperate regions, indicating that the human energy balance model cannot fully explain the influence of climate on use of public spaces; that is, psychological and behavioral factors also play important roles in outdoor thermal comfort.

These qualities affect the balance of energy of the human body and are applicable to an individual’s thermal perception. They have impacts on using outdoor spaces especially in hot and arid regions. This study investigates users’ thermal comfort in an urban park in Cairo, Egypt. The investigation was carried out during the hot and cold months using subjective surveys and field measurements. The campaign consisted of a subjective survey using questions on the perception of the thermal environmental applying seven-point ASHRAE 55 thermal sensation votes (TSV) in nine different zones in the urban park. At each zone, the thermal environment parameters – air temperature, solar radiation, air relative humidity and wind speed were measured. Through these data, the values of the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) were calculated in each zone using the RayMan model. The current people clothing and metabolic rate were recorded. The results of the field measurements were compared with judgements about the thermal environment. Results demonstrate that differences in the PET index among these zones due to different sky view factors (SVF) and wind speed. Results revealed an alteration in human comfort sensation between different landscape zones. This paper suggests that the thermal requirements of visitors and qualities of the local climate should be carefully considered when designing landscapes for the future urban parks in the hot and arid regions.},

	abstract = {The most important meteorological parameter affecting the human energy balance during sunny weather conditions is the mean radiant temperature Tmrt. It considers the uniform temperature of a surrounding surface giving off blackbody radiation, which results in the same energy gain of a human body given the prevailing radiation fluxes. This energy gain usually varies considerably in open space conditions. In this paper, the model ‘RayMan’, used for the calculation of short- and long-wave radiation fluxes on the human body, is presented. The model, which takes complex urban structures into account, is suitable for several applications in urban areas such as urban planning and street design. The final output of the model is, however, the calculated Tmrt, which is required in the human energy balance model, and thus also for the assessment of the urban bioclimate, with the use of thermal indices such as predicted mean vote (PMV), physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and standard effective temperature (SET*). The model has been developed based on the German VDI-Guidelines 3789, Part II (environmental meteorology, interactions between atmosphere and surfaces; calculation of short- and long-wave radiation) and VDI-3787 (environmental meteorology, methods for the human-biometeorological evaluation of climate and air quality for urban and regional planning. Part I: climate). The validation of the results of the RayMan model agrees with similar results obtained from experimental studies.},

In this paper, we present a method which combines the geometrical definition of the model with a finite element mesh. The geometrical representation is advantageous for the radiative component of the thermal problem while the finite element mesh is more adapted to the conductive part. Our method naturally combines these two representations of the model. The geometrical primitives are decomposed into cells. The finite element mesh is then projected onto these cells. This results in a ray tracing acceleration technique. Moreover, the ray tracing can be performed on the exact geometry, which is necessary if specular reflectors are present in the model. We explain how the geometrical method can be used with a finite element formulation in order to solve thermal situation including conduction and radiation. We illustrate the method with the model of a satellite.},

	abstract = {Ray tracing is used in calculations of radiant heat transfer to take account of the screening of radiation and also to determine the view factors of the radiation. In ray tracing by means of a finite-element mesh, the list of cells and boundaries that lie on the ray path may be generated. In standard ray tracing, the next cell is determined by checking the interaction of the ray with each possible face of the current cell contacted by the ray. The tracing of the ray may be accelerated on the basis that each ray passes over a similar trajectory to its predecessor and must intersect the same boundaries and cells at the beginning of its route. For each ray, determination of the next cell on its path entails checking the intersection with the face in the path of the preceding ray. If the ray does not intersect that face, the other faces are checked by the standard method. The proposed method is tested in calculating the geometric coefficients of the radiation in a model of a sectional furnace by means of a hexahedral mesh. In testing, both determinate and random methods of selecting the ray directions are chosen. Different numbers of rays from each face of the mesh involved in radiant heat transfer (the furnace walls, the surfaces of the blank and the rollers) are considered. The method with determinate choice of the directions is shown to be more effective with a greater number of rays. In the tests, between 221000 and 88 million rays are employed. In many cases (between 19.6 and 71.4\% of the total), it is sufficient to check the intersection of the ray with only one of the five cells, and the first face is intersected by the ray. This method does not impair the accuracy of the results and is up to 30\% faster.},

Some models are available in the literature for short time-step simulations of borehole heat exchangers. In this article, short time-step analyses of coaxial and double U-tube heat exchangers are performed by means of numerical capacity resistance model. The capacity resistance model is compared with field measurements, analytical solutions available in the literature, and commercial software based on the finite-element method. Further comparisons between coaxial and common double U-tube heat exchangers are carried out by means of measurements performed in a suitable plant system. Furthermore, the series and parallel arrangements for double U-tube heat exchangers are investigated considering the borehole thermal capacitance.},

	abstract = {In the present study, we investigate the determination accuracy of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). We study especially the UTCI uncertainties due to uncertainties in radiation fluxes, whose impacts on UTCI are evaluated via the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt). We assume "normal conditions", which means that usual meteorological information and data are available but no special additional measurements. First, the uncertainty arising only from the measurement uncertainties of the meteorological data is determined. Here, simulations show that uncertainties between 0.4 and 2 K due to the uncertainty of just one of the meteorological input parameters may be expected. We then analyse the determination accuracy when not all radiation data are available and modelling of the missing data is required. Since radiative transfer models require a lot of information that is usually not available, we concentrate only on the determination accuracy achievable with empirical models. The simulations show that uncertainties in the calculation of the diffuse irradiance may lead to Tmrt uncertainties of up to ±2.9 K. If long-wave radiation is missing, we may expect an uncertainty of ±2 K. If modelling of diffuse radiation and of longwave radiation is used for the calculation of Tmrt, we may then expect a determination uncertainty of ±3 K. If all radiative fluxes are modelled based on synoptic observation, the uncertainty in Tmrt is ±5.9 K. Because Tmrt is only one of the four input data required in the calculation of UTCI, the uncertainty in UTCI due to the uncertainty in radiation fluxes is less than ±2 K. The UTCI uncertainties due to uncertainties of the four meteorological input values are not larger than the 6 K reference intervals of the UTCI scale, which means that UTCI may only be wrong by one UTCI scale. This uncertainty may, however, be critical at the two temperature extremes, i.e. under extreme hot or extreme cold conditions.},

The majority of these indices are used sporadically or for specific purposes. Some are based on generalized results of measurements (wind chill, cooling power, wet bulb temperature) and some on the empirically observed reactions of the human body to thermal stress (physiological strain, effective temperature). Those indices that are based on human heat balance considerations are referred to as "rational indices". Several simple human heat balance models are known and are used in research and practice. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the newly developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), and some of the more prevalent thermal indices. The analysis is based on three groups of data: global data-set, synoptic datasets from Europe, and local scale data from special measurement campaigns of COST Action 730. We found the present indices to express bioclimatic conditions reasonably only under specific meteorological situations, while the UTCI represents specific climates, weather, and locations much better. Furthermore, similar to the human body, the UTCI is very sensitive to changes in ambient stimuli: temperature, solar radiation, wind and humidity. UTCI depicts temporal variability of thermal conditions better than other indices. The UTCI scale is able to express even slight differences in the intensity of meteorological stimuli.},

	abstract = {Radiative heat exchanges inside buildings remarkably affect the thermal balance of the human body in confined spaces and the related thermal comfort sensations of people. The mean radiant temperature is an important component of this balance. Unfortunately, it is usually computed by means of too simplified relationships, which significantly influence the comfort evaluations. Such simplified approaches are also accountable for a less effective design of HVAC systems which, in turn, could result in high energy consumption in the climatization of buildings. However, an accurate evaluation of the mean radiant temperature, especially when high intensity sources are present in a given internal space, depends on the angle factors between human subjects and surrounding surfaces of the enclosure. Angle factors, in turn, are direct functions of the projected area factors of the human body. Presently, there is still a certain lack in the availability of simple and reliable methods for computing angle factors of people in assigned postures, particularly in case of complex geometry and presence of heat high intensity sources, like sun. A comprehensive method is here introduced for evaluating the thermal comfort conditions of indoor spaces, avoiding the difficult singling out of several algorithms, dispersed in an inorganic way in the literature. A further contribution consists in the possibility of evaluating geometrically complex enclosures also in presence of direct solar radiation entering the room. Moreover, an analytical method for computing the projected area factors, based on experimental results, obtained by means of a photographic apparatus on purpose designed, is included in the methodology. An application of the method to a typical building situation in presence of direct solar radiation is also proposed.},

In the cross-sectional analysis of the data the room temperature was the most important indoor air parameter determining sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms and sensation of dryness, There was a linear correlation between the amount of SBS symptoms, sensation of dryness, and a rise in room temperature above 22°C. However, there was an excess of SBS symptoms, both when the temperature was considered to be too cold and too warm. This indicates that these symptoms can also be seen as an expression of general dissatisfaction with the temperature.

Due to the physical properties of water, hydronic systems can transport a given amount of thermal energy and use less than 5\% of the otherwise necessary fan energy. This improvement alone significantly reduces the energy consumption and peak-power requirement of the air conditioning system. Radiant cooling has never penetrated the US markets significantly. The scope of this survey is to show the advantages of radiant cooling in combination with hydronic thermal distribution systems, as compared to the commonly-used all-air systems. The report describes the development, thermal comfort issues, and cooling performance of the hydronic systems.

These include: (1) building performance simulation (BPS), (2) physical measurements (in laboratory test chambers and in buildings) and (3) human subject testing/occupant based surveys. This review identified eight conclusive studies: five studies that could not establish a thermal comfort preference between all-air and radiant systems and three studies showing a preference for radiant systems. Very few studies were based on occupant feedback in real buildings suggesting a significant research need.

Nevertheless, even though the direct component exerts the major contribute on this issue, especially in indoor environments and confined spaces, the diffuse and reflected components of the solar radiation also affects the thermal sensations of people. Despite this evidence, simple and reliable methods designed to take into account the effect of solar radiation on the indoor radiant field enveloping the human being in indoor environments are hardly available. This article aims to provide a contribute on this topic, proposing a model for the computation of the mean radiant temperature (MRT) in indoor environments in presence of solar radiation. The most innovative facet of the proposed model regards the computation of the effects of the radiation components reflected by the internal surfaces. Moreover, in order to try a preliminary validation of the model, an experimental campaign was also carried out and MRT values were measured in positions either directly irradiated by the sun or shielded from direct irradiation. The purpose of the measurements was to preliminarily analyze the extent of the accuracy with which the model might predict the rise of MRT due to solar direct irradiation.},

This paper deals with a critical review on the typical measurement methodologies combined with a comparative analysis of the metrological performances exhibited by the more common practice instruments on the market. To this purpose a special room-test has been designed aiming to reproduce the typical microclimatic conditions can be encountered in workplaces both in summer and in winter conditions. The effect of the measurement methodology and used instruments on the thermal comfort (global and local) and the thermal stress assessment has been finally discussed. Obtained results show that the use of different instruments consistent with ISO Standard 7726 requirements results in values of the mean radiant temperature compatible with each other, but the consequences on thermal environment assessment appear often ambiguous.

Typically the methods applied for calculating view factors between a person and its building surfaces requires great computational time. This research developed a view factor calculation method suitable for building energy simulations. The method calculates view factors by numerical integration of projected area factor. Over time the projected area factor of a person has been simplified by geometrical shapes. These shapes were compared with more complex equations on precision and calculation time. The same was done for the resulting view factors, where the results were compared with view factors found by ray tracing. While geometrical simplifications of the human body gave the fastest calculations, the complex equations gave the most accurate results. Non-rectangular surfaces and obstacles were treated by comparing intersection points with the edges of the surface, making the method applicable to rooms with complex geometry. The method for calculating view factors is robust and applicable to building energy simulation tools. Calculation time can be long depending on the complexity of geometry, grid-size and the choice of method for the projected area factor, but view factor calculations are done only once for a whole year simulation.},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort is determined by the combined effect of the six thermal comfort parameters: temperature, air moisture content, thermal radiation, air relative velocity, personal activity and clothing level as formulated by Fanger through his double heat balance equations. In conventional air conditioning systems, air temperature is the parameter that is normally controlled whilst others are assumed to have values within the specified ranges at the design stage. In Fanger’s double heat balance equation, thermal radiation factor appears as the mean radiant temperature (MRT), however, its impact on thermal comfort is often ignored. This paper discusses the impacts of the thermal radiation field which takes the forms of mean radiant temperature and radiation asymmetry on thermal comfort, building energy consumption and air-conditioning control. Several conditions and applications in which the effects of mean radiant temperature and radiation asymmetry cannot be ignored are discussed. Several misinterpretations that arise from the formula relating mean radiant temperature and the operative temperature are highlighted, coupled with a discussion on the lack of reliable and affordable devices that measure this parameter. The usefulness of the concept of the operative temperature as a measure of combined effect of mean radiant and air temperatures on occupant’s thermal comfort is critically questioned, especially in relation to the control strategy based on this derived parameter. Examples of systems which deliver comfort using thermal radiation are presented. Finally, the paper presents various options that need to be considered in the efforts to mitigate the impacts of the thermal radiant field on the occupants’ thermal comfort and building energy consumption.},

However, it has often been a practice to assume MRT equal to air temperature (Ta) during indoor thermal studies. In this paper, we have studied the consequences of this simplistic assumption on the thermal comfort of occupants in air-conditioned buildings. A worldwide database of about 10000 occupants covering 9 climatic zones and 4 seasons has been studied. The effect on comfort indices-Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), Actual Mean Vote (AMV), Thermal Acceptability Vote (TSA) and Thermal Preference Vote (MCI) are presented. It is observed that even a small difference in Ta and MRT can lead to significant error in determination of thermal comfort. A correlation study between AMV and the six Macpherson factors reveals that MRT has the highest positive correlation with the thermal sensation reported by the occupants. Study of TSA and MCI show that the assumption is more likely to affect comfort level determination in the uncomfortable range.},

The normal spectral emissivity and transmissivity serve as input for the inverse analysis. Consequently, the refractive index and absorption coefficient of the semitransparent material could be retrieved by using the pseudo source adding method as the forward method and the stochastic particle swarm optimization algorithm as the inverse method. Finally, the arbitrary apparent spectral directional emissivity of semitransparent material is estimated by using the pseudo source adding method given the retrieval refractive index and absorption coefficient. The present system has the advantage of a simple experimental structure, high accuracy, and excellent capability to measure the emissivity in an arbitrary direction. Furthermore, the apparent spectral directional emissivity of sapphire at 773 K is measured by using this system in a spectral range of 3 μm–12 μm and a viewing range of 0°–90°. The present method paves the way for a new directional spectral emissivity measurement strategy.},

Programs funded by the Department of Energy have revealed that this resource is definable and economically competitive with conventional fuels for use in direct heat applications. The resource, therefore, has the potential for reducing our dependence on the imported oil used for space heating. However, front-end costs and risks to explore, drill, test, and evaluate the magnitude of the resource have inhibited development. The question is, therefore, how much federal stimulation will be needed to convince private capital to exploit this widespread low-quality energy source.},

	abstract = {More than seventy district heating (DH) plants based on biomass are operating in South Tyrol (Italy) and most of them supply heat to residential districts. Almost 20\% of them are cogenerative systems, thus enabling primary energy savings with respect to the separate production of heat and power. However, the actual performance of these systems in real operation can considerably differ from the nominal one. The main objectives of this work are the assessment of the energy performance of a biomass boiler coupled with an Organic Rankine Cycle (i.e. ORC) generator under real operating conditions and the identification of its potential improvements. The fluxes of energy and mass of the plant have been measured onsite. This experimental evaluation has been supplemented with a thermodynamic model of the ORC generator, calibrated with the experimental data, which is capable to predict the system performance under different management strategies of the system. The results have highlighted that a decrease of the DH network temperature of 10 °C can improve the electric efficiency of the ORC generator of one percentage point. Moreover, a DH temperature reduction could decrease the main losses of the boiler, namely the exhaust latent thermal loss and the exhaust sensible thermal loss, which account for 9\% and 16\% of the boiler input power, respectively. The analysis of the plant has pointed out that the ORC pump, the flue gases extractor, the thermal oil pump and the condensation section fan are the main responsible of the electric self-consumption. Finally, the negative effect of the subsidisation on the performance of the plant has been discussed.},

Hence, the aim of this work is to provide a general method to evaluate this physical quantity for human body based on indirect calorimetry data. To calculate the metabolism on an exergy basis it is necessary to define the reference reactions and obtain their exergy variation. The reference reactions of the energy substrates are represented by the oxidation of the glucose, palmitic acid and a representative amino acid. Hence, from the exergy variation of these reactions and the consumption rate of the substrates, the metabolic exergy is determined. Results, for basal conditions and during physical activities, indicate that the difference between exergy and energy metabolisms is lower than 5\%. Moreover, the body converts approximately 60\% of the exergy of nutrients into available exergy to perform work.},

Provision for indoor air movement was one of the wellsprings of traditional architectural design in warm regions, affecting building form, components, and equipment over millennia. However, this design option has faded from practice since the advent of air-conditioning, in which the focus has been on controlling temperature and humidity. Despite the fact that air movement can be an energy efficient alternative to air cooling, it became viewed more as a possible source of undesirable draft, and comfort standards came to set room airspeed limits very low, even for temperatures as warm as 26ºC (79ºF). An exception was granted if the airspeed source was under personal individual control, such as a window in a private office, or a desk fan, but only above 26 ºC (79ºF).},

	abstract = {Thermal conductivity and thermal borehole resistance are basic parameters for the technical and sustainable design of closed ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems. One of the most common methods to determine these parameters is the thermal response test (TRT). The response data measured are typically evaluated by the Kelvin line source equation which does not consider all relevant processes of heat transfer in the subsurface. The approach only considers conductive heat transfer from the borehole heat exchanger (BHE) and all transport effects are combined in the parameters of effective thermal conductivity and thermal borehole resistance. In order to examine primary effects in more detail, a sensitivity study based on numerically generated TRT data sets is performed considering the effects of (1) the in-situ position of the U-shaped pipes of borehole heat exchangers (shank spacing), (2) a non-uniform initial thermal distribution (such as a geothermal gradient), and (3) thermal dispersivity. It will be demonstrated that the shank spacing and the non-uniform initial thermal distribution have minor effects (less than 10\%) on the effective thermal conductivity and the determined borehole resistance. Constant groundwater velocity with varying thermal dispersivity values, however, has a significant influence on the thermal borehole resistance. These effects are even more pronounced for interpreted effective thermal conductivity which is overestimated by a factor of 1.2–2.9 compared to the real thermal conductivity of the saturated porous media.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses how a built environmental control system such as space heating and cooling can be described by the concept of “exergy”, which quantifies what is consumed by any working systems from man-made systems such as heat engines or buildings to biological systems including human body. The reason for the intensive and extensive use of exergy concept is to deepen our understanding of the built environment and thereby to develop a variety of low-exergy systems for future buildings. First, the essence of exergy balance equations is reviewed and then some results obtained from the recent exergy research were presented. The important findings described in this paper are as follows: (1) a volume of indoor air contains both of “warm” or “cool” exergy and of “wet” or “dry” exergy, whose values are comparable to each other especially for a hot and humid summer condition; (2) an ordinary air-source heat pump is basically a device to separate exergy supplied by electricity into warm, cool and dry exergies by consuming more than 85\% of the supplied exergy; (3) there is a set of a little higher mean radiant temperature and a little lower air temperature, which provides with the lowest human body exergy consumption rate in winter season; (4) availability of cool radiant exergy of 20–40mW/m2 seems to play a key role for thermal comfort in a naturally-ventilated room in summer season; and (5) “cool” radiant exergy available from the sky in hot and humid regions amounts to 1000mW/m2, which is not necessarily small if compared to the values of cool radiant exergy to be supplied indoors.},

These benefits stem from the improved productivity of the office worker in most favorable thermal environment and the possibilities to achieve this with lower energy demand. This study uses a new approach, exergy analysis, to recognise the optimal conditions by looking for the combination of mean radiant temperature and room air temperature giving the lowest human body exergy consumption rate. All of the commonly used thermal comfort prediction methods use energy analysis, and it seems that exergy analysis could give more accurate prediction of the conditions giving optimal thermal comfort. The new method is applied to the case of office worker in typical and extreme weather conditions in Finland. The results agree well with the previous analyses, and moreover, the points giving minimum human body exergy consumption rate coincide with the points usually regarded as most comfortable in summer conditions.

Exergy is a thermodynamic property that links the first and the second thermodynamic principles as well as connects a system under study with the environment where it belongs. Since the first principle of thermodynamics measures quantity of energy and the second measures irreversibilities, i.e. quality of energy, having a single thermodynamic indicator which is able to deal with both issues at the same time means a great advance in energy sustainability studies. Our review shows that using exergy for weak sustainability studies presents some problems, but still offers a worthy contribution to this field, more valuable than pure economic analyses. Strong sustainability assessments featuring exergy show more drawbacks and complications, but can also play a key role in a sustainability framework designed in order to obtain sustainable policies which are able to maintain homeostatic relations between the system under study and its environment, thus complementing traditional economic approaches which are mainly focused on the economic and social poles of sustainability.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyse the efficiency of building interventions both from building and user point of view. With exergy analysis based on the connective thinking approach, thermal exergy flows through the building envelope are analysed jointly with human body exergy balance. Two cases of building envelope systems, thermally well-insulated case and thermally non-insulated case, are located at four typical climates (temperate, cold, hot/dry, hot/humid). “Warm” and “cool” exergies transferred by radiation, convection and conduction at the interior surface of an envelope are calculated with methodology developed by Shukuya (2013) [7,35]. Human body exergy balance (hBExB) is calculated with software developed by Asada (2010) [6]. Results show that thermal insulation significantly reduces the exergy consumption rate (ExCr) within building envelope systems in all climates. Additionally, it allows the interior surfaces of building envelope to emit “warm” radiant exergy into the room space in temperate and cold climates, while on the other hand to emit “cool” radiant exergy instead of “warm” radiant exergy in hot/dry and hot/humid climates. Thermal insulation has important benefits on hBExB in all climates; it decreases human body exergy consumption rate (hbExCr) due to lower input exergy and higher output exergy. Exergy analysis based on the connective thinking approach helps us to understand all interactions between building systems and human body and consequently approach to the quantitative evaluation of comfort and healthy living and working conditions.},

Commonly used indices based on the estimate of the heat flow between the human and its environment includes the well-known Fanger's method, also known as the PMV-PPD thermal comfort model. Recently this thermodynamic approach has been expanded with the application of the second law of thermodynamics. In this paper, an exergy-based analysis of the relation between the human and its environment is presented. Heat and mass flow rate due to convection, radiation, evaporation and respiration are calculated and expressed in terms of exergy loss. This value is used in the modified Fanger's thermal comfort model, where the heat balance equation is replaced by the exergy loss. The paper builds upon prior studies on determination of internal and external exergy losses by revised and newly defined formulas taking into account clothing and indoor conditions. The results quantitatively show that thermal energy load in the original Fanger's PMV model could be substituted by exergy loss and it corresponds to a certain level of subjective assessed thermal comfort level.},

We set up an experiment that the subjects stayed in two rooms, one with natural ventilation and the other with mechanical air-conditioning. According to “energy” calculation, input energy rate almost the same as the total of output energy rate, within which a portion by sweat secretion in naturally ventilated room was larger than that in mechanically air-conditioned room. On the other hand, according to “exergy” calculation, the large portion of input exergy rate consisting mainly of metabolism and liquid water by sweat secretion was found to be consumed. In naturally ventilated room, the exergy consumption rate increases by walking and then decreases gradually towards the end of staying, but in mechanically air-conditioned room it suddenly became large right after entering and dropped more sharply than in naturally ventilated room. This is because the liquid water by sweat, which has wet exergy, dispersed into the surrounding air very rapidly in mechanically air-conditioned room whose humidity is very low. The measured values of sweat evaporation rate were larger than the calculated values based on the two-node model although their patterns of variation were similar to each other. Conventional air conditioning for cooling, which necessitates a large input of exergy by electricity, was found to result in a large amount of human-body exergy consumption.},

	abstract = {Exergy analysis has been used in various fields to quantify the efficiency of various energy transfer processes. So far, most exergy analyses have been performed by assuming steady-state conditions both for a system of focus and its environment. However, steady-state analyses may idealize a problem too much and thereby limit what we can know about the system, since the assumed system is only a snapshot of a certain condition or moment. In particular, a steady-state exergy analysis is not suitable for analyzing problems where the system has a large heat capacity and problems with varying boundary conditions. To understand the exergy transfer and consumption processes in a system whose transient characteristics are critical, an unsteady-state exergy analysis must be conducted. This study presents a methodology for unsteady-state exergy analysis that can be used to study heat conduction problems. Governing equations of entropy and exergy to be parallel to the governing equation of energy are derived in their partial differential forms, and their numerical methods are presented in detail. Based on the proposed methodology, an unsteady-state exergy analysis of a heat conduction problem for a concrete wall is carried out to demonstrate its transient exergy behavior.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the application of exergy analysis to human heat and mass exchange with the indoor environment. The basis for this paper is the existence of a formal similarity between the parameters defining human heat and mass transfer governed by physiological processes and the parameters defining exergy destruction. Basic heat and mass transfer is calculated using a standard two-node human physiological model. To enable an exergy analysis the model was divided according to heat and mass transfer over appropriate boundaries. The exergy analysis was performed for each process with regard to the type of exergy that participates in heat and mass exchange with respect to the indoor environment. The results provide insight into the complex interactions between the human body and environment as characterized by exergy destruction. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that at given physiological parameters only a certain combination of environmental conditions ensures minimal exergy destruction. These environmental and human conditions coincide with expected level of thermal comfort.},

	abstract = {A precedent study about the effects of obesity on exergy behavior concluded that higher body fat per se does not lead to higher mortality among obese people; the focus must be turned to obesity-related diseases. Therefore, the next step towards the understanding of the effects of pathologies on the exergy behavior of human body is to analyze human heart. In the present work, an exergy model of human heart is developed. The heart is divided into two control volumes: the left heart, which pumps arterial blood from the lungs to the organs, and the right heart, which pumps venous blood from the organs to the lungs. Exergy of metabolism, exergy transfer associated to heat of metabolism, difference of exergy of blood flows and performed work are taken into account in the exergy balance for normotensive and hypertensive people under different levels of exercise. The left part of the heart is always responsible for more than 80\% of the total exergy destruction. Moreover, a hypertensive heart destroys more exergy; this surplus value, when integrated along life cycle, represents 170 MJ/kg of destroyed exergy, which, according to the rate of living theory, would lead to a loss of 4.4 years in life expectancy.},

Hypothermia is also used during surgeries and circulatory arrest. In this article, the objective temperature of hypothermia is 32 °C, which is considered mild: 32–35 °C. Three techniques of hypothermia induction were considered: external blood cooling, endovascular cooling with a catheter insertion and water bath. Energy and exergy analyses were performed to determine the clinical effectiveness of these techniques and to evaluate the best test parameters, from which it was possible to calculate the body internal temperature, destroyed exergy and exergy efficiency. Moreover, it was proposed an exergy performance index, which takes into account the ability of a given technique to change the exergy of the body. Results indicate that therapeutic hypothermia takes the subject to a state of lower destroyed exergy and higher body exergy efficiency. The exergy performance index shows that lower rates of cooling lead to a better transformation of the exergy removed from the body into variation of the body exergy.},

Herein, the exergy destroyed rate of the human body will be determined as a function of temperature and humidity for three levels of exercise. For the sake of comparison, thermal comfort will also be assessed by means of PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) index. Results indicate that, the higher the relative humidity, the lower the temperature of thermal comfort and, for the same humidity, the higher the exercise intensity, the smaller the temperature of thermal comfort. On the other hand, the values of PMV do not vary much with relative humidity, what indicates that the effect of this parameter is almost neglected by this method. Besides, the difference between the three levels of exercise was not as pronounced as in the exergy method. During activity, the values of the exergy flow rate due to evaporation for thermal comfort are smaller in the exergy method than in the conventional one. Thus, it can be said that, under physical activities, the exergy method for thermal comfort seems to be a reliable alternative to the conventional one.},

The cardiopulmonary exercise test is one of the most used tests to assess the functional capacity of individuals with varying degrees of physical training. To perform the exergy analysis during the test, it is necessary to calculate heat and mass flow rates, associated with radiation, convection, vaporization and respiration, determined from the measurements and some relations found in the literature. The energy balance allowed the determination of the internal temperature over time and the exergy variation of the body along the experiment. Eventually, it was possible to calculate the destroyed exergy and the exergy efficiency from the exergy analysis. The exergy rates and flow rates are dependent of the exercise level and the body metabolism. The results show that the relation between the destroyed exergy and the metabolism is almost constant during the test, furthermore its value has a great dependence of the subject age. From the exergy analysis it was possible to divide the subjects according to their training level, for the same destroyed exergy, subjects with higher lactate threshold can perform more work.},

In literature only destroyed exergy has been used to evaluate thermal sensation. To perform the exergy balance it is necessary to calculate the exergy variation of the body over time which is a composition of metabolic exergy and the exergy variation due to transient environmental conditions. The exergy transfer to the environment is calculated as the sum of the terms associated with radiation, convection, evaporation and respiration. The thermal behavior of the human body is simulated by a model composed of 15 cylinders, naked and dressed for winter seasons, as a function of the air temperature, mean radiant temperature and relative humidity. The energy equation is solved to obtain transitory response of the body due to a variation in environmental conditions and the energy transfer to the environment. For relative humidities between 40\% and 60\%, results indicate that the destroyed exergy is minimal for thermal comfort conditions. Nevertheless, for low relative humidities and high temperatures the destroyed exergy is also minimal, indicating the necessity of another physical quantity to evaluate thermal comfort conditions. At this point the exergy transfer to environment is high, showing that the body may not be at thermal comfort condition. This article proposes is to use two terms of the exergy analysis to evaluate the thermal comfort condition: destroyed exergy and exergy transfer to environment.},

Thus, it would be practical either to find a combined model applicable to all conditions or the underlying effects for the observed differences. This paper compares all three approaches by three distinctive procedures: first, conditions leading to temperatures within the adaptive comfort range and those leading to the minimum HBx-rate are compared first based on hourly weather data and second on general assumptions; Third, for the datasets contained in the ASHRAE comfort database, the PMV-value, adaptive comfort temperature, and HBx-rate are calculated and the results compared. According to the first procedure, a linear relationship between adaptive comfort temperature and minimum HBx-rate is found. The exploration of results gained by using the ASHRAE comfort database showed that the minimum HBx-rate corresponds well to the neutral temperature given by the adaptive comfort model. These results can be used as a starting point for a further exploration of differences and similarities between the three approaches, which may lead to a combined model of thermal comfort. Nevertheless, more detailed analyses are necessary to obtain statistically and theoretically assured conclusions.},

It helps to optimize climate conditioning systems so that they meet the requirements of sustainable building design. As the building should provide a healthy and comfortable environment for its occupants, it is reasonable to consider both the exergy flows in building and those within the human body. Until now, no data have been available on the relation between human-body exergy consumption rates and subjectively assessed thermal sensation. The objective of the present work was to relate thermal sensation data, from earlier thermal comfort studies, to calculated human-body exergy consumption rates. The results show that the minimum human body exergy consumption rate is associated with thermal sensation votes close to thermal neutrality, tending to the slightly cool side of thermal sensation. Generally, the relationship between air temperature and the exergy consumption rate, as a first approximation, shows an increasing trend. Taking account of both convective and radiative heat exchange between the human body and the surrounding environment by using the calculated operative temperature, exergy consumption rates increase as the operative temperature increases above 24°C or decreases below 22°C. With the data available so far, a second-order polynomial relationship between thermal sensation and the exergy consumption rate was established.},

These examples relate the human-body exergy consumption rate with subjectively obtained thermal sensation votes and had been based on steady-state calculation methods. However, humans are rarely exposed to steady-state thermal environments. Therefore, the first objective of the current paper was to compare a recently introduced unsteady-state model with previously used steady-state model using data obtained under both constant and transient temperature conditions. The second objective was to explore a relationship between the human-body exergy consumption rate and subjective assessment of thermal environment represented by thermal sensation as well as to extend the investigation towards thermal acceptability votes. Comparison of steady-state and unsteady-state model showed that results from both models were comparable when applied to data from environments with constant operative temperature. In contrast, when applied to data with temperature transients the prediction of particular models differed significantly and the unsteady-state model resulted in better prediction of mean skin temperature. The results of the present study confirmed previously indicated trends that lowest human body exergy consumption rate is associated with thermal sensation close to neutrality. Moreover, higher acceptability was in general associated with lower human body exergy consumption rate.},

The human body exergy consumption calculated by the formula was compared with values calculated using Shukuya's formula for a typical office environment. The results show that human body exergy consumption calculated by either of these formulas reaches a minimum under the same thermal condition. It is shown that this is in accordance with expectation. The relation between human performance and human body exergy consumption was studied by analyzing the data obtained in simulated office environments in winter. The results show that human body exergy consumption and human performance are inversely as operative temperature changes from 17 to 28°C or human thermal sensation changes from −1.0 to +1.4, and that optimum thermal comfort cannot be expected to lead to optimal human performance, as has so often been assumed. According to the second law of thermodynamics, it makes sense that optimal human performance coincides with minimum human body exergy consumption and that this should occur under thermal conditions in which human thermal sensation is close to “slightly cool”.},

	abstract = {The short-term behavior of borehole heat exchangers (BHE) is investigated using three 2 h test sequences each with constant inlet temperature and constant mass flow rate. Three models of the transient systems simulation program (TRNSYS) have been compared to these measurements. In order to assess the deviations a 3D-FEM model, built in COMSOL Multiphysics®, is compared to the measurement as well. The “Erdwärmesonden” model (EWS) shows a very good accuracy with a deviation less than 10\%. The superposition borehole model (SBM) and duct ground heat storage model (DST) neglect the internal borehole heat capacity of fluid and grout. In order to improve their short-term behavior, the models are modified with an adiabatic pipe model with wall capacity in front of the BHE model. Different parameter sets for the pre-pipe are investigated. The optimum parameter set reduces the error between simulation and measurement of the injected heat from 50\% to about 5\%. With this model modification, all investigated models SBM, DST, and EWS perform as accurate as the COMSOL model.},

The borehole heat exchanger field is coupled to a heat pump in winter and to the cold distribution system in summer through a flat plate heat exchanger. The cooling requirement satisfied by a direct heat transfer into the ground through the borehole heat exchangers is so-called geocooling. A dynamic system model has been developed to simulate the building, the emission of thermal energy through thermally activated building systems, the technical installation including the borehole heat exchanger field and the interconnected thermal interactions. Thermal comfort requirements determine the building energy needs and the size of the ground coupled system. A methodology is presented for best system design. Building design, system technical feasibility and limits of the ground coupled system are discussed and result from the analysis of the numerous system simulations. Geocooling potential depends on the quality of the building design and its heat emission. The importance of the ground thermal conductivity and the ground recharge ratio on the system design are highlighted. Simple design sizing keys are proposed for a fast pre-sizing of a borehole field.},

	abstract = {High-density urban environment affects urban microclimate, and thermal comfort of outdoor spaces. Shading by urban structure is the primary measure to reduce daytime mean radiant temperature (MRT) by blocking direct solar radiation. However, it is believed that overly-restricted Sky View Factor (SVF) limits the radiative cooling by the sky of lower effective temperature. Therefore, this study aimed at examining the relationship between SVF and MRT in built environment. To investigate the dependence of MRT on SVF via radiant fluxes, this study performed field measurement of six directional long-wave, short-wave fluxes and MRT across a number of outdoor spaces under shaded in densely built environment. Regression analysis was employed in examining desired relationships. Across different open spaces, MRT would increase by 1.6 K per 10 W/m2 increase of either long-wave or short-wave radiant fluxes. Global solar radiation and air temperature are the most influential meteorological parameters affecting radiant fluxes components in MRT. Besides, this study suggests the use of long-wave mean radiant temperature (LMRT) representing effective surface temperature of surrounding objects. LMRT generally follows the temporal pattern of reference air temperature. In a case study, if SVF is decreased by 0.1, the weighted sum of long-wave fluxes would be increased by 10 W/m2. This would bring an increase of 1.6 K in MRT. But, SVF has weak explanatory power to variations in short-wave fluxes when under shaded. Larger SVF is preferred for cooling open space in hot and humid region if direct sunlight is already blocked by urban morphology.},

The characteristics of this type of system have been studied by making temperature and air flow measurements in a test chamber over a range of operating parameters typical of office applications. Results from the displacement ventilation study are consistent with other studies and show that normalized temperature profiles are independent of internal heat gain. Linear temperature gradients in the lower part of the room were found, in all cases, to be driven by convection from the adjacent walls. Significant mixing, indicated by reduced temperature gradients, was evident in the upper part of the room in the chilled ceiling results at higher levels of heat gain. Visualization experiments, velocity measurements and related numerical studies indicated that with greater heat gains the plumes have sufficient momentum to drive flow across the ceiling surface and down the walls. The significance of forced, as opposed to natural convection, is also suggested by relatively low Richardson Number (Ri) values found near the ceiling. Furthermore, in cases with moderately high internal gains, comparison of the temperature gradients indicated that the effect of ceiling surface temperature on the degree of mixing and the magnitude of the temperature gradient were of secondary importance. These findings are in contrast to the view that it is natural convection at the ceiling that causes enhanced mixing.},

Vertical radiant temperature asymmetry was found to have an insignificant effect on the overall thermal comfort of the seated occupants for the typical range of ceiling temperatures that would be encountered in practice in such combination environments. There was a slight trend for the reported sensation of ‘freshness’ to increase as ceiling temperature was reduced though this requires further study.

However, the thermal performance of radiant systems in buildings has not been fully understood and accounted for in currently available building energy simulation software. The challenging tasks to improve the applicability of radiant systems are the development of an accurate prediction model and its integration in the energy simulation software. This paper addresses the development of a semi-analytical model for radiant heating and cooling systems for integration in energy simulation software that use the one-dimensional numerical modeling to calculate the heat transfer within the building construction assemblies. The model combines the one-dimensional numerical model of the energy simulation software with a two-dimensional analytical model. The advantage of this model over the one-dimensional one is that it accurately predict the contact surface temperature of the circuit-tubing and the adjacent medium, required to compute the boiler/chiller power, and the minimum and maximum ceiling/floor temperatures, required for moisture condensation (ceiling cooling systems), thermal comfort (heating floor systems) and controls. The model predictions for slab-on-grade heating systems compared very well with the results from a full two-dimensional numerical model.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study of indoor thermal environment near a full-scale glass facade with different types of shading devices under varying climatic conditions in winter. Interior glazing and shading temperature, operative temperature and radiant temperature asymmetry were measured for façade sections with roller shades and venetian blinds at different positions. Interior glass surface temperatures can be high during sunny days with low outdoor temperature. Shading systems significantly improved operative temperature and radiant temperature asymmetry during cold sunny days, depending on their properties and tilt angle. During cloudy days the impact was smaller, however the shading layers could still decrease the amount of heat loss through the façade. A transient building thermal model, which also calculates indoor environmental indices under the presence of solar radiation, was developed and compared with the experimental measurements. Part II of this paper uses this validated model with a transient, two-node thermal comfort model (including transmitted solar radiation) for assessment of indoor environmental conditions with different building envelope and shading properties, façade location and orientation.},

	abstract = {When the sun shines on people in enclosed spaces, such as in buildings or vehicles, it directly affects thermal comfort. There is also an indirect effect as surrounding surfaces are heated exposing a person to re-radiation. This laboratory study investigated the effects of long wave re-radiation on thermal comfort, individually and when combined with direct solar radiation. Nine male participants (26.0 +/- 4.7 years) took part in three experimental sessions where they were exposed to radiation from a hot black panel heated to 100 degrees C; direct simulated solar radiation of 600 Wm(-2) and the combined simulated solar radiation and black panel radiation. Exposures were for 30 min, during which subjective responses and mean skin temperatures were recorded. The results showed that, at a surface temperature of 100 degrees C (close to maximum in practice), radiation from the flat black panel provided thermal discomfort but that this was relatively small when compared with the effects of direct solar radiation. It was concluded that re-radiation, from a dashboard in a vehicle, for example, will not have a major direct influence on thermal comfort and that existing models of thermal comfort do not require a specific modification. These results showed that, for the conditions investigated, the addition of re-radiation from internal components has an effect on thermal sensation when combined with direct solar radiation. However, it is not considered that it will be a major factor in a real world situation. This is because, in practice, dashboards are unlikely to maintain very high surface temperatures in vehicles without an unacceptably high air temperature. This study quantifies the contribution of short- and long-wave radiation to thermal comfort. The results will aid vehicle designers to have a better understanding of the complex radiation environment. These include direct radiation from the sun as well as re-radiation from the dashboard and other internal surfaces.},

Three studies investigated the effects of (1) the intensity of direct simulated solar radiation, (2) spectral content of simulated solar radiation and (3) glazing type on human thermal sensation responses. Eight male subjects were exposed in each of the three studies. In Study 1, subjects were exposed to four levels of simulated solar radiation: 0, 200, 400 and 600 Wm−2. In Study 2, subjects were exposed to simulated solar radiation with four different spectral contents, each with a total intensity of 400 Wm−2 on the subject. In Study 3, subjects were exposed through glass to radiation caused by 1,000 Wm−2 of simulated solar radiation on the exterior surface of four different glazing types. The environment was otherwise thermally neutral where there was no direct radiation, predicted mean vote (PMV)=0±0.5, [International Standards Organisation (ISO) standard 7730]. Ratings of thermal sensation, comfort, stickiness and preference and measures of mean skin temperature (tsk) were taken. Increase in the total intensity of simulated solar radiation rather than the specific wavelength of the radiation is the critical factor affecting thermal comfort. Thermal sensation votes showed that there was a sensation scale increase of 1 scale unit for each increase of direct radiation of around 200 Wm−2. The specific spectral content of the radiation has no direct effect on thermal sensation. The results contribute to models for determining the effects of solar radiation on thermal comfort in vehicles, buildings and outdoors.},

	abstract = {The near zone of supply air diffusers is very critical for the indoor climate. Complaints of draft are often associated with low-velocity diffusers in displacement ventilation because the air is discharged directly into the occupied zone. Today, the knowledge of the near zone of these air supply diffusers is insufficient, causing an increased need for better measuring methods and representation of the occupied zone. A whole-field measuring technique has been developed by the authors for visualization of air temperatures and airflow patterns over a large cross-section. In this particular whole-field method, air temperatures are measured with an infrared camera and a measuring screen placed in the airflow. The technique is applicable to most laboratory and field test environments. It offers several advantages over traditional techniques; for example, it can record real-time images within large areas and capture transient events. The purpose of this study was to conduct a parameter and error analysis of the proposed whole-field measuring method applied to a flow from a low-velocity diffuser in displacement ventilation. A model of the energy balance, for a solid measuring screen, was used for analyzing the influence of different parameters on the accuracy of the method. The analysis was performed with respect to the convective heat transfer coefficient, emissivity, screen temperature and surrounding surface temperatures. Theoretically, the temperature difference between the screen and the ambient air was found to be 0.2–2.4°C for the specific delimitation in the investigation. However, after applying correction the maximum uncertainty of the predicted air temperature was found to vary between 0.62 and 0.98°C, due to uncertainties in estimating parameters used in the correction. The maximum uncertainty can be reduced to a great extent by estimating the convective heat transfer coefficient more accurately and using a screen with rather low emissivity.},

Acquisition of sensor data of a building is essential to ensure the improvement of the indoor thermal environment for the occupants. The environmental sensor technologies together with Building Information Modeling (BIM) are tools for assessing/analyzing the performance of a building. Although BIM has a potential to verify thermal performance by using a BIM database, integrating the surface-heat of building envelopes and sensing data has not been fully explored in the existing BIM. BIM requires tools to enable building professionals to effectively detect the location of thermal defects and analyze the thermal performance and indoor thermal comfort by accommodating environmental information to be used in the analysis process. Therefore, this research presents a novel method for integrating time-stamped 3D thermal data in the BIM. In the proposed method, the BIM model is integrated with spatio-temporal thermal and air temperature data. Visual scripting is used for extracting and then mapping spatio-temporal thermal data to a 3D BIM model. The proposed system converts the collected thermal images into numeric surface temperatures, integrates collected environmental data in the BIM, calculates thermal comfort variables, such as mean radiant temperature (MRT), and assesses the thermal comfort level for various locations inside the building. The applicability of the proposed method is validated in a real-world case study. The developed prototype system provides valuable visualization information and statistical data for analyzing thermal performance and assessing the thermal comfort level.},

One is based on morphology and is computationally efficient, while the other is based on spatial isotropic wavelets and is flexible; both require the support of a reliable facial tracker. We validated the two algorithms against the clinical standard in a controlled lab experiment where orienting responses were invoked on n=18 subjects via auditory stimuli. Then, we used the validated algorithms to quantify stress of surgeons (n=24) as they were performing suturing drills during inanimate laparoscopic training. This is a field application where the new methodology shines. It allows nonobtrusive monitoring of individuals who are naturally challenged with a task that is localized in space and requires directional attention. Both algorithms associate high stress levels with novice surgeons, while low stress levels are associated with experienced surgeons, raising the possibility for an affective measure (stress) to assist in efficacy determination. It is a clear indication of the methodology's promise and potential.},

	abstract = {To study the reliability of formulas for calculating mean skin temperature (Tsk), values were computed by 18 different techniques and were compared with the mean of 10,841 skin temperatures measured by infrared thermography. One hundred whole-body infrared thermograms were scanned in ten resting males while changing the air temperature from 40 degrees C to 4 degrees C. Local, regional average and mean skin temperatures were obtained using an image processing system. The agreement frequency, defined as the percentage of the calculated Tsk values which agreed with the corresponding infrared thermographic Tsk within +/- 0.2 degree C, ranged for with the various formulas from 7\% to 80\%. In many sites, the local skin temperature did not coincide with the regional average skin temperature. When the local skin temperatures which showed the highest percentage similarity to the regional average skin temperature within +/- 0.4 degree C were applied to the formula, the agreement frequency was markedly improved for all formulas. However, the agreement frequency was not affected by changing the weighting factors from specific constants to individually measured values of regional surface area. By applying the physiologically reliable accuracy range of +/- 0.2 degree C in the moderate and +/- 0.4 degree C in the cool condition, agreement frequencies of at least 95\% were observed in formulas involving seven or more skin temperature measurement sites, including the hand and foot. We conclude that calculation of a reliable mean skin temperature must involve more than seven skin temperature measurement sites regardless of ambient temperature. Optimal sites for skin temperature measurement are proposed for various formulas.},

The theoretical fundamentals are discussed. They include a design stage, the mathematical modeling, the measurement procedure, and the performance evaluation through error analysis. The measuring system consists of a set of auxiliary devices (targets) arranged on a measurement grid. An infrared camera measures their temperature histories. From each temperature chronology, the three ambient parameters are locally deduced together by solving an inverse heat transfer problem. The results are then mapped to provide a 2D or 3D visualization. The question of identifiability is addressed leading to a robust parameter estimation algorithm. The robustness of the algorithm is tested for a wide range of noisy data during a numerical experiment. The numerical data are built by varying the air speed from 0 ms−1 to 2 ms−1 with a step of 0.2 ms−1, the air temperature from 15 °C to 30 °C with a step of 3 °C and the mean radiant temperature from 15 °C to 30 °C with a step of 3 °C. It appears that stability and repeatability are guaranteed by the presented method for the range of ambient parameters and accuracy usually found and needed in indoor conditions. Brief illustrative experimental results are given as an initial validation of the method. Since the spatial distributions of these ambient parameters are obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, the method is suitable for indoor microclimate mapping, visualization of air patterns, building inspection, thermal comfort assessment, etc.},

	abstract = {The solar and longwave environmental irradiance geometry (SOLWEIG) model simulates spatial variations of 3-D radiation fluxes and mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) as well as shadow patterns in complex urban settings. In this paper, a new vegetation scheme is included in SOLWEIG and evaluated. The new shadow casting algorithm for complex vegetation structures makes it possible to obtain continuous images of shadow patterns and sky view factors taking both buildings and vegetation into account. For the calculation of 3-D radiation fluxes and Tmrt, SOLWEIG only requires a limited number of inputs, such as global shortwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, geographical information (latitude, longitude and elevation) and urban geometry represented by high-resolution ground and building digital elevation models (DEM). Trees and bushes are represented by separate DEMs. The model is evaluated using 5 days of integral radiation measurements at two sites within a square surrounded by low-rise buildings and vegetation in Göteborg, Sweden (57°N). There is good agreement between modelled and observed values of Tmrt, with an overall correspondence of R2 = 0.91 (p {\textless} 0.01, RMSE = 3.1 K). A small overestimation of Tmrt is found at locations shadowed by vegetation. Given this good performance a number of suggestions for future development are identified for applications which include for human comfort, building design, planning and evaluation of instrument exposure.},

Rhino/Grasshopper is one of the most widely used platforms that are used by designers today. There are already a number of environmental plugins developed for Rhino/Grasshopper. However, Ladybug offers several advantages that are currently not offered by existing Rhino/Grasshopper related environmental design plugins. Ladybug imports standard EnergyPlus Weather files (.EPW) in Grasshopper and provides a variety of 2D and 3D designer-friendly interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during the initial stages of design. It also simplifies the process of analysis, automates and expedites the calculations, and provides easy to understand graphical visualizations in the 3D modeling interface of Rhino/Grasshopper. It also allows users to work with validated energy and daylighting engines such as EnergyPlus, Radiance and Daysim. Integration with the parametric tools of grasshopper allows for almost instantaneous feedback on design modifications, and as it runs within the design environment, the information and analysis is interactive. The development is a free and open source; users can customize the tool based on their needs and contribute to the source code.Copyright},

There are cases when only the energy quantity is taken into account and the human side of the problem is neglected. The new energy saving ideas should be analysed from thermal comfort point too. The aim of our research was to see which the influence of the room geometry on the mean radiant temperature is, assuming similar heating systems and thermal properties of the building envelope. It was found that mean radiant temperature has a parabolic variation with the room height and length, so for a room shape there is a certain height for which the mean radiant temperature is minimal. The occupant position in the room influences the obtained values. Lower mean radiant temperature values are obtained for surface heating systems.

The models predict these subjective responses to the environment from thermophysiological measurements or predictions (skin and core temperatures). The models apply to a range of environments: uniform and non-uniform, transient and stable. They are based on diverse results from the literature and from body part-specific human subject tests in a climate chamber. They were validated against a test of passengers in automobiles. This series is intended to present the rationale, structure, and coefficients for these models so that others can test and develop them further as additional empirical data becomes available. The experimental methods and some measured results from the climate chamber tests have been published previously. Part I describes thermal sensation models representing 19 individual local body parts. The models' structure and coefficients were derived by regression of skin and core temperatures against thermal sensation votes obtained in the chamber experiments. The sensation for each local body part is predicted by a logistic function with four inputs: local skin temperature, mean-skin temperature presenting the whole-body thermal state, and the time derivatives of skin and core temperatures representing the response to transients. These inputs can be obtained from thermophysiological computer programs that treat the body as multiple segments.},

Furthermore, with the combined ventilation system used to handle latent load, the radiant cooling system has proven applicable in hot and humid climates. It is well known that the RHC system has advantages of low draught risk, quiet operation, low energy consumption, and ability for design integration with building elements. These merits have motivated numerous studies on RHC systems in terms of comfort, heat transfer analysis, energy simulation, control strategy, system configurations and so on. Many studies have demonstrated that the RHC system is a good solution to improve indoor environmental quality while reducing building energy consumption for heating and cooling. On the other hand, the RHC system has limitations such as complicated control of Thermally Activated Building System (TABS), acoustical issues, higher capital cost and cooling load than conventional air systems, and so on. For now, the required mitigation of these limitations and the need to extend the applicability of the RHC system are providing the continuous impetus for research on RHC systems. This paper summarizes the important issues involved in the research on RHC system, whereby ten questions and answers concerning the RHC system are discussed, which will help researchers to conduct relevant studies.},

	abstract = {In recent years high-resolution numerical simulation of surface–plant–air interactions as an important part of global circulation models (GCM) or as a tool to assist in planning decisions has experienced increased consideration. In contrast large scale phenomena described in GCMs, the lower part of the atmosphere where we live is very sensitive to small scale processes which can develop an individual local climate, different to the expected average conditions. Especially in urban areas the great variety of different surfaces and sheltering obstacles produces a pattern of distinct microclimate systems. To simulate these local effects, microscale surface–plant–air interaction schemes with a special extension to typical artificial urban boundaries are needed. The paper focuses on the microscale numerical simulation of surface–plant–air interactions inside urban structures, especially the feedback between artificial surfaces like buildings and vegetation inside street canyons, backyards or greens. The three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model ENVI-met is presented and used to solve the basic equations forward in time and can simulate `hard' wind field modifications (solid boundaries) like walls as well as `soft' modifications (porous shelters) like vegetation. A case study of building a small park inside the CBD area will show what effects even small changes can have on local flow and temperature fields.},

	abstract = {The globe thermometer has been commonly used as a meteorological instrument for measuring the mean radiant temperature for at least 80 years. Originally it consisted of a hollow copper sphere. In recent years, the acrylic globe thermometer has also become widely used for outdoor measurements because of its fast response and being more economical to produce. However it has been found that the mean radiant temperature measured by an acrylic globe thermometer is mostly inconsistent with that of the more accurate three-dimensional integral method. To investigate why such a discrepancy occurs, static indoor experiments and dynamic outdoor experiments were conducted to compare and explore the thermal response of both a copper and an acrylic globe thermometer. The measurements were also compared with theoretical predictions. In addition, the spatial distributions of temperature on the exterior surface and along the interior axis of the globe were measured. The effect of surface optical properties was also discussed. The primary reasons for the temperature differences between copper and acrylic globe thermometer are analysed. Based on above analysis, we conclude that the acrylic globe thermometer is not suitable for the measurement of outdoor diurnal mean radiant temperature. The conclusions are then generalized to metallic and non-metallic globes.},

It can seriously affect the productivity and the health of the individual and diminish tolerance to other environmental hazards. However, the assessment of the thermal stress and the translation of the stress in terms of physiological and psychological strain is complex. For over a century attempts have been made to construct an index, which will describe heat stress satisfactorily. The many indices that have been suggested can be categorized into one of three groups: "rational indices", "empirical indices", or "direct indices". The first 2 groups are sophisticated indices, which integrate environmental and physiological variables; they are difficult to calculate and are not feasible for daily use. The latter group comprises of simple indices, which are based on the measurement of basic environmental variables. In this group 2 indices are in use for over four decades: the "wet-bulb globe temperature" (WBGT) index and the "discomfort index" (DI). The following review summarizes the current knowledge on thermal indices and their correlates to thermal sensation and comfort. With the present knowledge it is suggested to adopt the DI as a universal heat stress index.},

	abstract = {Projected area factors for individual segments of the standing and sedentary human body were modelled for both direct and diffuse solar radiation using detailed 3D geometry and radiation models. The local projected area factors with respect to direct short-wave radiation are a function of the solar azimuth angle (alpha) between 0 degrees {\textless} alpha{\textless}360 degrees and the solar altitude (beta) angles between -90 degrees {\textless} beta{\textless}+90 degrees . In case of diffuse solar radiation from the isotropic sky the local human projected area factors were modelled as a function of the ground albedo (rho) ranging between 0{\textless} rho{\textless}1. The model was validated against available experimental data and showed good general agreement with projected area factors measured for both the human body as a whole and for local quantities. Scientists can use the equations to predict the inhomogeneous irradiation and absorption of direct and diffuse solar radiation and UV-radiation at surfaces of the human body. In conjunction with detailed multi-node models of human thermoregulation the equations can be used to predict the physiological implications of solar radiation and outdoor weather conditions on humans.},

In numerous chamber experiments, physiological parameters were adopted to assess thermal comfort, but the experiments' conclusions may not represent a realistic thermal environment due to the highly controlled thermal environment and few occupants. This paper focuses on determining the relationships between upper extremity skin temperatures (i.e., finger, wrist, hand and forearm) and the indoor thermal comfort. Also, the applicability of predicting thermal comfort by using upper extremity skin temperatures was explored. Field studies were performed in office buildings equipped with split air-conditioning (SAC) located in the hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) climate zone of China during the summer of 2016. Psychological responses of occupants were recorded and physical and physiological factors were measured simultaneously. Standard effective temperature (SET*) was used to incorporate the effect of humidity and air velocity on thermal comfort. The results indicate that upper extremity skin temperatures are good indicators for predicting thermal sensation, and could be used to assess the thermal comfort in terms of physiological mechanism. In addition, the neutral temperature was 24.7 °C and the upper limit for 80\% acceptability was 28.2 °C in SET*.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of an extensive literature review on the topic of thermal adaptation in the built environment. The adaptive approach to modeling thermal comfort acknowledges that thermal perception in ‘real world’ settings is influenced by the complexities of past thermal history and cultural and technical practices. An important premise of the adaptive model is that the person is no longer a passive recipient of the given thermal environment, but instead is an active agent interacting with the person—environment system via multiple feedback loops. Thermal adaptation can be attributed to three different processes—behavioral adjustment, physiological acclimatization and psychological habituation or expectation. Both climate chamber and field evidence indicates that the slower process of acclimatization is not so relevant to thermal adaptation in the relatively moderate conditions found in buildings, whereas behavioral adjustment and expectation have a much greater influence. One of the most important findings from our review of field evidence was the distinction between thermal comfort responses in air-conditioned vs. naturally ventilated buildings, most likely resulting from a combination of past thermal history in the buildings and differences in levels of perceived control.},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort is determined by the combined effect of the six thermal comfort parameters: temperature, air moisture content, thermal radiation, air relative velocity, personal activity and clothing level as formulated by Fanger through his double heat balance equations. In conventional air conditioning systems, air temperature is the parameter that is normally controlled whilst others are assumed to have values within the specified ranges at the design stage. In Fanger’s double heat balance equation, thermal radiation factor appears as the mean radiant temperature (MRT), however, its impact on thermal comfort is often ignored. This paper discusses the impacts of the thermal radiation field which takes the forms of mean radiant temperature and radiation asymmetry on thermal comfort, building energy consumption and air-conditioning control. Several conditions and applications in which the effects of mean radiant temperature and radiation asymmetry cannot be ignored are discussed. Several misinterpretations that arise from the formula relating mean radiant temperature and the operative temperature are highlighted, coupled with a discussion on the lack of reliable and affordable devices that measure this parameter. The usefulness of the concept of the operative temperature as a measure of combined effect of mean radiant and air temperatures on occupant’s thermal comfort is critically questioned, especially in relation to the control strategy based on this derived parameter. Examples of systems which deliver comfort using thermal radiation are presented. Finally, the paper presents various options that need to be considered in the efforts to mitigate the impacts of the thermal radiant field on the occupants’ thermal comfort and building energy consumption.},

This paper investigates the simplification of past studies that the Tmrt is equal to the air temperature (Ta) under indoor conditions. In a second step, the causes for deviations between the two parameters are examined and integrated into the context of indoor climate. Measurements were conducted in four rooms at the Geography Department of Humboldt University in Berlin during autochthonal weather conditions from the 16th of August to the 2nd of September 2013. Tmrt was derived using integral radiation measurements and three different types of globe thermometers. The study indicates that the deviations between the different methods of obtaining Tmrt are negligible for indoor environments. The results show that the differences between Ta and Tmrt are negligible during most periods, as stated in previous literature. As air temperatures increase, however, Tmrt exceeds Ta up to 1.3 K. The examination of the surface temperatures indicates that rooms with window walls facing southeast and southwest show the largest disparities between Ta and Tmrt. The correlation between Ta and Tmrt and the sum of the short and long wave radiation specifies the radiation intensity and duration as the main driver of Tmrt. Future studies on indoor heat stress should hence consider that Tmrt and Ta can differ depending on the characteristics of the room and on solar radiation.},

	abstract = {The mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is one of the most important meteorological parameters governing human energy balance. In this paper, three different methods of obtaining the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting are compared. Method A is based on integral radiation measurements and angular factors, method B is based on measurements with a 38-mm flat grey globe thermometer and in method C makes use of the Rayman 1.2 software is used. Measurements were performed in a large open square in a high latitude city—Göteborg, Sweden—during clear to overcast weather conditions in October 2005 and in July and August 2006. Results show that the difference between Method A and Method B was generally relatively small. Most of the discrepancy, caused by rapid changes in radiation, temperature and wind speed was smoothed out using 5 min mean values. By systematically and empirically changing the mean convection coefficient, the accuracy of Method B was improved and a new equation expressing the Tmrt was obtained. With this new equation the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer could successfully be used to estimate the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting provided that the wind speed and the air and globe temperatures are measured accurately. The study also shows that the flat grey colour of the globe thermometer slightly underestimates the level of short-wave radiation (i.e. sunshine). Method C works very well during the middle of the day in July, i.e. at high sun elevations. However, the model considerably underestimates the Tmrt in the morning and evening in July and during the whole day in October, i.e. at low sun elevations. In outdoor urban settings where thermal comfort researchers or urban planners and designers require an easy and reliable method of estimating mean radiant temperature, the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer provides a good and cheap solution.

Moreover, many different subjective judgement scales were used to assess subjective thermal perception, thermal neutrality and thermal preference and a multitude of thermal indices were used to quantify the combined effect of meteorological variables on thermal perception. The use of a variety of methods makes it difficult to compare results of the different studies. There is thus a need for standardization and to give guidance regarding how to conduct field surveys in outdoor environments. Such standards and guidelines should give advice regarding the choice of measurement sites, type and positioning of instruments, appropriate methods to determine the mean radiant temperature, questionnaire design and suitable thermal comfort indices. These guidelines should also include advice on reporting.},

Based on the thermal comfort model, the relationships between low mean radiant temperature and other thermal microclimate parameters such as indoor air temperature, air velocity, and relative humidity were analyzed. The improved and reasonable combinations of four thermal microclimate parameters including radiant cooling surface temperature, air temperature, air velocity, and relative humidity were further derived. Furthermore, a number of new thermal comfort charts using radiant cooling surface temperature and air temperature as dominant parameters were drawn. The results show that the air temperature can be increased 1–3℃ within the recommended thermal comfort range when the mean radiant temperature is reduced 3℃. Under the design goal of thermal neutral, when the chilled ceiling surface temperature is in the range of 16–26℃, the air temperature should be set at 25.3–29.3℃; when the chilled floor surface temperature is in the range of 19–26℃, the air temperature should be set at 25.8–29.2℃. The design values of air velocity and relative humidity are not recommended to be changed, and still can follow the design standards for conventional all-air systems., Practical application: In this paper, some issues about indoor microclimate parameters design in radiant cooled buildings were discussed. A number of new thermal comfort charts using radiant cooling surface temperature and air temperature as dominant parameters were provided, and the design values of indoor air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air velocity, and relative humidity for radiant cooling system in residential buildings were also suggested.

The aim of our research was to see which the influence of the room geometry on the mean radiant temperature is, assuming similar heating systems and thermal properties of the building envelope. It was found that mean radiant temperature has a parabolic variation with the room height and length, so for a room shape there is a certain height for which the mean radiant temperature is minimal.

	abstract = {A microscale three-dimensional (3-D) urban energy balance model, Temperatures of Urban Facets in 3-D (TUF-3D), is developed to predict urban surface temperatures for a variety of surface geometries and properties, weather conditions, and solar angles. The surface is composed of plane-parallel facets: roofs, walls, and streets, which are further sub-divided into identical square patches, resulting in a 3-D raster-type model geometry. The model code is structured into radiation, conduction and convection sub-models. The radiation sub-model uses the radiosity approach and accounts for multiple reflections and shading of direct solar radiation. Conduction is solved by finite differencing of the heat conduction equation, and convection is modelled by empirically relating patch heat transfer coefficients to the momentum forcing and the building morphology. The radiation and conduction sub-models are tested individually against measurements, and the complete model is tested against full-scale urban surface temperature and energy balance observations. Modelled surface temperatures perform well at both the facet-average and the sub-facet scales given the precision of the observations and the uncertainties in the model inputs. The model has several potential applications, such as the calculation of radiative loads, and the investigation of effective thermal anisotropy (when combined with a sensor-view model).},

	abstract = {The effects of artificial turf (AT) on the urban canopy layer energy balance, air and surface temperatures, and building cooling loads are compared to those of other common ground surface materials (asphalt, concrete, and grass) through heat transfer modeling of radiation, convection, and conduction. The authors apply the Temperatures of Urban Facets in 3D (TUF3D) model—modified to account for latent heat fluxes—to a clear summer day at a latitude of 33° over a typical coastal suburban area in Southern California. The low albedo of artificial turf relative to the other materials under investigation results in a reduction in shortwave radiation incident on nearby building walls and an approximately equal increase in longwave radiation. Consequently, building walls remain at a relatively cool temperature that is similar to those that are adjacent to irrigated grass surfaces. Using a simple offline convection model, replacing grass ground cover with artificial turf was found to add 2.3 kW h m−2 day−1 of heat to the atmosphere, which could result in urban air temperature increases of up to 4°C. Local effects of AT on building design cooling loads were estimated. The increased canopy air temperatures with AT increase heat conduction through the building envelope and ventilation in comparison with a building near irrigated grass. However, in this temperate climate these loads are small relative to the reduction in radiative cooling load through windows. Consequently, overall building design cooling loads near AT decrease by 15\%–20\%. In addition, the irrigation water conservation with AT causes an embodied energy savings of 10 W h m−2 day−1. Locally, this study points to a win–win situation for AT use for urban landscaping as it results in water and energy conservation.},

	abstract = {Large use of solar energy for heating purposes requires large heat storage facilities to overcome the seasonal discrepancy between the summer heat supply and the winter heat demand. Different types of heat stores in the ground have been extensively studied both from the practical and theoretical point of view. Included are water-based heat stores, e.g. pits and rock caverns, and duct ground heat stores, e.g. vertical coils in clay and boreholes in rock. Practical experience is more extensive for water stores than for ground stores.

However, duct ground stores are a very interesting alternative. Large stores can be achieved at a low cost, without requiring exclusive use of large ground surface area. Such stores have to be studied and optimised in a complete energy system. Duct ground heat stores fed by solar collectors are characterised by intensive heat transfer rates that last only part of a day. This phenomenon results in large temperature differences between the heat carrier fluid and the average temperature level of the store, and produces unnecessary quality losses. The use of a water buffer tank between  the solar collectors and the store will improve the system's performance. In consequence, different possibilities of system operation are possible.

Research work is required to characterise such systems, in order to establish an optimal ratio between the different subsystems' size as well as to develop a strategy for an optimal system operation. Detailed and accurate system simulation programmes are required to perform such analysis.

This study has been carried out in the Department of Mathematical Physics at Lund University (Sweden), financed by a grant from the National Swiss Funds for Scientific Research, which was awarded by the Research Commission of the University of Geneva (Switzerland).},

	abstract = {Le dimensionnement d’un système de chauffage solaire utilisant un stockage diffusif dans le terrain demande des procédures de calculs qui prennent en compte les différents processus thermiques impliqués. Il est important d’évaluer aussi bien les performances thermiques à court terme qu’à long terme. Dans le stockage souterrain par exemple, le transfert de chaleur le long de l’échangeur souterrain est influencé par différents facteurs, tels que les conditions d’exploitation des derniers jours de marche du système, qui déterminent le profil de température dans le voisinage de l’échangeur souterrain, et le niveau de température moyen du terrain, qui varie normalement selon une base saisonnière. Les performances thermiques du stockage durant les premières années de marche est affecté par les pertes thermiques relativement élevées causées par le réchauffement du terrain environnant. Dans le but d’obtenir une évaluation précise du bilan énergétique du système, ses performances thermiques doivent être calculées avec un pas de temps très court (de l’ordre de l’heure) durant plusieurs années, voir même la durée de vie du système. Le dimensionnement final est généralement établi avec l’aide de simulations numériques détaillées, et repose sur la capacité du programme de calcul à reproduire le comportement thermique que montrera le système une fois réalisé.
Des outils de simulation robustes et précis, utilisant le programme de simulation dynamique TRNSYS, ont été développés pour simuler des systèmes de chauffage solaire avec un stockage diffusif dans le terrain. TRNSYS est un programme de simulation modulaire bien connu, offrant une grande flexibilité pour la simulation de systèmes thermiques partiels ou complets. Les systèmes simulés comprennent un champ de capteurs solaires, un stockage court terme à eau, un stockage long terme de type diffusif dans le terrain, un apport d’énergie d’appoint et un réseau de distribution de chaleur pour satisfaire les besoins de chauffage et d’eau chaude sanitaire d’un groupe de maisons familiales. Grâce à TRNSYS, qui constitue une base standard pour le développement par l’utilisateur de modèles de simulation spécifiques, les modèles utilisés pour simuler le champ des capteurs solaires et les deux stockages représentent l’état de l’art dans le domaine. L’utilisation répandue de TRNSYS dans le monde par des ingénieurs et des chercheurs favorise des coopérations internationales ainsi que le transfert d’expertise technologique.
Les outils de simulation développés avec TRNSYS ont été construits et validés sur la base d’études approfondies de la réponse thermique d’un champ de capteurs solaires couplés à un stockage diffusif dans le terrain. Elles ont également permis d’améliorer le modèle de calcul DST, qui permet la simulation d’un stockage diffusif. D’autres modules de calcul ont été développés pour les besoins des outils de simulation. Ces derniers permettent de simuler un système avec différents niveaux de complexité et de détail, en fonction des besoins de l’analyse. En outre, ils sont facilement adaptables à un problème particulier grâce à la flexibilité du programme TRNSYS.
Les outils de simulation sont utilisés pour simuler un système défini pour des conditions types que l’on rencontre en Suisse. Le coût du kilowattheure solaire est minimisé pour différentes fractions solaires. Des rapports optimaux entre les tailles des principaux composants du système sont cherchés pour permettre un dimensionnement rapide. L’influence de l’importance de la demande de chaleur annuelle, de la part relative de l’eau chaude sanitaire ainsi que des niveaux de température de distribution de chaleur sont analysés. Quelques milliers de simulations ont été effectuées de manière à caractériser le comportement thermique de tels systèmes ainsi que de mettre en évidence les points importants. Des comparaisons avec des systèmes ne possédant qu’un stockage à eau ont permis de montrer qu’un stockage diffusif devient économiquement plus attractif pour des fractions solaires supérieures à 50\%, i. e. pour des besoins de stockage saisonnier.},

However, the DST model can simulate only regularly placed BHEs, particularly in cylindrical borefield configurations. As a possibility to describe irregular borefield configurations by adjusting BHE spacing has been reported, we propose optimal values of BHE spacing for typical irregular BHE cases using the GenOpt optimization tool. A regression model based on a set of results obtained from the optimization is proposed to calculate the modified spacing for the DST model directly without optimization simulations. The proposed regression model fits to the datasets of the optimization with an accuracy of 96.5\% in predicting the modified BHE spacing. The differences in time-averaged EWTs between the DST model with the proposed modified spacing and a reference model are close to zero, and they are less than 0.5 °C. However, other borefield configurations that have not been used for the model development can result in higher errors.},

The first part of the paper derives the fundamental equations for BHE systems and their finite element representations, where the thermal exchange between the borehole components is modeled via thermal transfer relations. For this purpose improved relationships for thermal resistances and capacities of BHE are introduced. Pipe-to-grout thermal transfer possesses multiple grout points for double U-shape and single U-shape BHE to attain a more accurate modeling. The numerical solution of the final 3D problems is performed via a widely non-sequential (essentially non-iterative) coupling strategy for the BHE and porous medium discretization. Four types of vertical BHE are supported: double U-shape (2U) pipe, single U-shape (1U) pipe, coaxial pipe with annular (CXA) and centred (CXC) inlet. Two computational strategies are used: (1) The analytical BHE method based on Eskilson and Claesson's (1988) solution, (2) numerical BHE method based on Al-Khoury et al.'s (2005) solution. The second part of the paper focusses on BHE meshing aspects, the validation of BHE solutions and practical applications for borehole thermal energy store systems.},

	title = {Medium {Deep} {High} {Temperature} {Heat} {Storage}},
	abstract = {Heating of buildings requires about 45 \% of the total end energy consumption of industrialized countries. Shallow geothermal systems for indirect use as well as shallow geothermal heat storage systems like aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) or borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) typically provide low exergy heat. The temperature levels and ranges require typically a coupling with heat pumps.
By storing hot water from solar panels or thermal power stations with temperatures of up to 100 °C a medium deep high temperature heat storages (MDHTS) can be operated on a high temperature level which is characterized by 60 to 130 °C. Therefore heat pumps are not necessary and low temperature floor heating is not mandatory because MDHTS can be operated in conjunction with classical radiator heating systems. Furthermore storage depths of 500 to 1.500 m below the surface avoid conflicts with groundwater use for other purposes. Additionally the temperature difference between the storage system and the surrounding rocks becomes smaller with increased depths so thermal losses are decreasing; permeability is typically decreasing with greater depth therefore conduction becomes dominant, especially in the crystalline basement. Solar-thermal charging of a medium deep heat storage system is a very beneficial option for supplying heat in urban and rural systems.
Feasibility and design criteria of different system configurations will be presented. One system is designed to store and supply heat (300 kW) for an office building. The required boreholes are located in a granodioritic environment. Resulting from this setup several challenges have to be addressed. The drilling and completion has to be planned carefully as well as the geological and tectonical situation of the drill site will be assessed. In addition to the MDHTS system the results of this drill site will help to characterize potential target horizons in the nearby Upper Rhine Valley where several deep hydro- and petrothermal projects are already in operation and new ones are planned which targeting the same geological formations.},

The radiant ceiling panel system and conventional air-conditioning system were compared in terms of thermal comfort, energy consumption, and cost. Thermal environment, along with human response, was tested by using a small meeting room equipped with radiant ceiling panels. The responses were collected by questionnaires given to the male subjects in the room. The experiment for the female subjects was conducted separately. Results show that the radiant ceiling panel system is capable of creating smaller vertical variation of air temperature and a more comfortable environment than conventional systems. When using a cooled ceiling, a small volume of supplied air creates a less draught environment, which reduced the discomfort of feeling cold in the lower part of the body. Numerical simulation of yearly energy consumption and cost estimation were conducted. Typical office rooms located on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th floor of a six-floor building in the Tokyo area were simulated. Since part of the sensible heat load is handled by radiant ceiling panels, the volume of supplied air can be reduced, leading to lower energy consumption for air transport. By using the radiant ceiling panel system in one of the three floors of the simulated building, energy consumption can be reduced by 10\%. Estimated pay back time was from 1 to 17 years depending on the market price of the radiant ceiling panel.},

	abstract = {Whilst there have been numerous categorisations of high-rise buildings according to their function, architectural style, height or structural strategy, historically little work has been undertaken to classify them based on factors affecting their energy performance — their shape and form, façade, attitude to natural lighting, ventilation strategies, etc. These factors have been influenced by regulatory changes, developments in technology and materials, changes in architectural thinking and economic and commercial drivers. Developments such as the New York Zoning Law of 1916, the postwar innovations in curtain wall façades and the energy crises of the 1970s have all impacted on the way tall buildings of the time were designed and operated. These events also had a significant impact on the quantity of energy and the way in which it was consumed in tall buildings of the time. This paper examines the history of energy use in tall buildings, from their origins in North America in the late nineteenth century to the present day. In doing so, it categorises tall buildings into five chronological ‘generations’, based on their energy consumption characteristics.},

	abstract = {Correlations between outdoor thermal indices and the calculated or measured mean radiant temperature Tmrt are in general of high importance because of the combined effect on human energy balance in outdoor spaces. The most accurate way to determine Tmrt is by means of integral radiation measurements, i.e. measuring the short- and long-wave radiation from six directions using pyranometers and pyrgeometers, an expensive and not always an easily available procedure. Some studies use globe thermometers combined with air temperature and wind speed sensors. An alternative way to determine Tmrt is based on output from the RayMan model from measured data of incoming global radiation and morphological features of the monitoring site in particular sky view factor (SVF) data. The purpose of this paper is to compare different methods to assess the mean radiant temperature Tmrt in terms of differences to a reference condition (Tmrt calculated from field measurements) and to resulting outdoor comfort levels expressed as PET and UTCI values. The Tmrt obtained from field measurements is a combination of air temperature, wind speed and globe temperature data according to the forced ventilation formula of ISO 7726 for data collected in Glasgow, UK. Four different methods were used in the RayMan model for Tmrt calculations: input data consisting exclusively of data measured at urban sites; urban data excluding solar radiation, estimated SVF data and solar radiation data measured at a rural site; urban data excluding solar radiation with SVF data for each site; urban data excluding solar radiation and including solar radiation at the rural site taking no account of SVF information. Results show that all methods overestimate Tmrt when compared to ISO calculations. Correlations were found to be significant for the first method and lower for the other three. Results in terms of comfort (PET, UTCI) suggest that reasonable estimates could be made based on global radiation data measured at the urban site or as a surrogate of missing SR data or globe temperature data recorded at the urban area on global radiation data measured at a rural location.},

The initial results demonstrate that a purely physiological approach is inadequate in characterising comfort conditions outdoors, and an understanding of the dynamic human parameter is necessary in designing spaces for public use. The thermal environment is indeed of prime importance influencing people’s use of these spaces, but psychological adaptation (available choice, environmental stimulation, thermal history, memory effect, expectations) is also of great importance in such spaces that present few constraints.},

	abstract = {The mean radiant temperature, Tmrt, which sums up all shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes (both direct and reflected) to which the human body is exposed is one of the key meteorological parameters governing human energy balance and the thermal comfort of man. In this paper, a new radiation model (SOLWEIG 1.0), which simulates spatial variations of 3D radiation fluxes and Tmrt in complex urban settings, is presented. The Tmrt is derived by modelling shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes in six directions (upward, downward and from the four cardinal points) and angular factors. The model requires a limited number of inputs, such as direct, diffuse and global shortwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, urban geometry and geographical information (latitude, longitude and elevation). The model was evaluated using 7 days of integral radiation measurements at two sites with different building geometries – a large square and a small courtyard in Göteborg, Sweden (57°N) – across different seasons and in various weather conditions. The evaluation reveals good agreement between modelled and measured values of Tmrt, with an overall good correspondence of R2 = 0.94, (p {\textless} 0.01, RMSE = 4.8 K). SOLWEIG 1.0 is still under development. Future work will incorporate a vegetation scheme, as well as an improvement of the estimation of fluxes from the four cardinal points.},

They are the six direction radiation method, globe thermometer method, RayMan model, ENVI-met model and SOLWEIG model. The comparison shows that globe thermometer method may overestimate the Tmrt since wind velocity is a key variable in the estimation based on this method. For better estimation, Tmrt measured by the globe-thermometer method be corrected by the imported wind speed (stable, low and assuming wind speed) and validated by the six-direction radiation method. The comparison of models shows that the RayMan model’s evaluation of Tmrt involving global radiation with fine time resolution was better than the corresponding evaluations under the other two models (ENVI-met and SOLWEIG) in this case. However, the RayMan model can only assess Tmrt for a one-point one-time context, whereas the other two models can evaluate two-dimensional Tmrt. For two-dimensional evaluations of Tmrt, SOLWEIG have a better prediction of Tmrt than ENVI-met, and ENVI-met can simulate several different variables, which are wind field, particle distribution, CO2 distribution and the other thermal parameters (Ta, surface temperature and radiation fluxes), that SOLWEIG cannot.},

This paper examines how T mrt varies within an urban setting and how it is influenced by cloudiness. In addition, variations of T mrt in three high latitude cities are investigated in order to analyse the impact of geographical context and climate conditions. Results showed large spatial variations between sunlit and shaded areas during clear weather conditions, with the highest values of T mrt close to sunlit walls and the lowest values in the areas shaded by buildings and vegetation. As cloudiness increases, the spatial pattern is altered and the differences are reduced. The highest T mrt under cloudy conditions is instead found in open areas where the proportion of shortwave diffuse radiation from the sky vault is high. A regional comparison between three Swedish coastal cities showed that T mrt during summer is similar regardless of latitudinal location. On the other hand, large differences in T mrt during winter were found. Shadows, both from buildings and vegetation are the most effective measure to reduce extreme values of T mrt. However, extensive areas of shadow are usually not desired within outdoor urban environments at high latitude cities. One solution is to create diverse outdoor urban spaces in terms of shadow and also ventilation. This would provide individuals with access to a choice of thermal environments which they can use to assist their thermal regulation, based on personal needs and desires.},

	abstract = {The effect of variations in land cover on mean radiant surface temperature (Tmrt) is explored through a simple scheme developed within the radiation model SOLWEIG. Outgoing longwave radiation is parameterised using surface temperature observations on a grass and an asphalt surface, whereas outgoing shortwave radiation is modelled through variations in albedo for the different surfaces. The influence of surface materials on Tmrt is small compared to the effects of shadowing. Nevertheless, altering ground surface materials could contribute to a reduction on Tmrt to reduce the radiant load during heat-wave episodes in locations where shadowing is not an option. Evaluation of the new scheme suggests that despite its simplicity it can simulate the outgoing fluxes well, especially during sunny conditions. However, it underestimates at night and in shadowed locations. One grass surface used to develop the parameterisation, with very different characteristics compared to an evaluation grass site, caused Tmrt to be underestimated. The implications of using high resolution (e.g. 15 minutes) temporal forcing data under partly cloudy conditions are demonstrated even for fairly proximal sites.},

	abstract = {Abstract Health studies have repeatedly used air temperature (Ta), sometimes adjusted for humidity, when analyzing the impact of weather on mortality. The aim of this study is to highlight the importance of mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) and its impact on heat related mortality. Tmrt is an essential meteorological parameter that influences the thermal comfort (heat load) of humans. It is useful when assessing the impact of weather, especially heat, on peopleâs health. Tmrt is directly influenced by urban geometry and surface material, which also makes it a good measure to identify urban hot spots. The performance of models using Ta and Tmrt for daily mortality is compared for Stockholm County, Sweden. It is demonstrated that Tmrt models fit heat related mortality better than Ta models, which implies that health studies should consider using Tmrt rather than Ta. The use of Tmrt models allows us to determine more accurate thresholds for increased risks of heat related mortality, and thus to better identify adverse weather conditions and heat prone urban geometries. Such information is needed to implement heat-warning systems and mitigate harmful effects of heat stress.},

However, buildings are rarelystudied in use to examine if the design intent of a sufficiently daylit and a visuallycomfortable work environment is achieved from the perspective of building occupants orhow occupant use of shading devices may affect electrical lighting energy reduction fromphotocontrols. This dissertation develops a field-based approach to daylightingperformance assessment that pairs repeated measures of occupant subjective responseusing a novel desktop polling station device with measurements of the physicalenvironment acquired using High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging and otherenvironmental sensors with the objective of understanding the physical environmentalconditions acceptable to occupants. The approach is demonstrated with a 6-month fieldstudy involving (N=44) occupants located in perimeter and core open-plan office spacesin the San Francisco Federal Building1 (SFFB). Over 23,100 subjective assessmentspaired with physical measures were analyzed to develop models of visual discomfort andshade control and to examine the assumptions of existing daylighting performanceindicators. The analysis found that existing daylight performance indicatorsoverestimated the levels of daylight illuminance required by occupants to workcomfortably without overhead ambient electrical lighting. Time-lapse observation ofinterior roller shades showed that existing shade control models overestimated thefrequency of shade operation and underestimated the level of facade occlusion due tointerior shades. Comparison of measured results to the daylighting objectives of theSFFB showed that available daylight enabled electrical lighting energy reduction in theperimeter zones but not in the open-plan core zones. The results extend existingknowledge regarding the amount of daylight illuminance acceptable for occupants towork comfortably without overhead electrical lighting and for the physical variables (andstimulus intensities) associated with visual discomfort and the operation of interiorshading devices.},

This paper presents the results of experiments designed to assess the radiant heat received by a man in a controlled temperature room in which non-uniform environments were achieved by locating a heated panel either overhead or on one wall. The m.r.t. was determined with reference to a point using (a) the solid angle and temperature of each surface of the room, (b) a radiation thermopile, and (c) a globe thermometer. The m.r.t. was also determined with reference to (a) a cylinder 68 in. in height and 12 in. in diameter, and (b) models of standing and sitting men. It seems that in indoor environments, where there is no intense radiation from sharply localized sources, the single estimation of m.r.t. with a globe thermometer at 45 in. above the floor will generally give a satisfactory indication of the heat load on a standing or sitting man.},

Beginning with basic concepts, the book proceeds successively on to more advanced principles, theories, and practices for developing and implementing comprehensive environmental policy solutions. Topics are introduced in a logical, yet connected, user-friendly manner. Using practical case studies and examples, the book illustrates both the power and limitations of theoretical approaches. It defines the scope and nature of the environmental policy problem, outlining its origins and evolution, and introduces the policy frameworks of the United Nations, European Union, and the United States.  Each chapter begins with a case study and ends with a problem set; the questions are designed to elicit practical and critical thinking. The book ends with two capstone problems that exemplify nearly every major topic and aspect presented in this book.

	abstract = {This paper evaluates current and historical drilling and completion costs of oil and gas wells and compares them with geothermal wells costs. As a starting point, we developed a new cost index for US onshore oil and gas wells based primarily on the API Joint Association Survey 1976–2009 data. This index describes year-to-year variations in drilling costs and allows one to express historical drilling expenditures in current year dollars. To distinguish from other cost indices we have labeled it the Cornell Energy Institute (CEI) Index. This index has nine sub-indices for different well depth intervals and has been corrected for yearly changes in drilling activity. The CEI index shows 70\% higher increase in well cost between 2003 and 2008 compared to the commonly used Producer Price Index (PPI) for drilling oil and gas wells. Cost trends for various depths were found to be significantly different and explained in terms of variations of oil and gas prices, costs, and availability of major well components and services at particular locations. Multiple methods were evaluated to infer the cost-depth correlation for geothermal wells in current year dollars. In addition to analyzing reported costs of the most recently completed geothermal wells, we investigated the results of the predictive geothermal well cost model WellCost Lite. Moreover, a cost database of 146 historical geothermal wells has been assembled. The CEI index was initially used to normalize costs of these wells to current year dollars. A comparison of normalized costs of historical wells with recently drilled ones and WellCost Lite predictions shows that cost escalation rates of geothermal wells were considerably lower compared to hydrocarbon wells and that a cost index based on hydrocarbon wells is not applicable to geothermal well drilling. Besides evaluating the average well costs, this work examined economic improvements resulting from increased drilling experience. Learning curve effects related to drilling multiple similar wells within the same field were correlated.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to characterize the uncertainty associated with the cost of drilling and completion of geothermal wells. Previous research and publications have produced correlations for the average cost of geothermal wells as a function of well depth. This project develops this concept further by using a probabilistic approach to evaluate the distribution of geothermal well costs for a range of well depths. The well cost uncertainty was characterized by identifying the main cost components of geothermal wells and quantifying the probability distributions of the key variables controlling these costs. These probability distributions were determined based on the detailed cost records of U.S. geothermal wells drilled or designed from 2009 to 2013 as well as cost data from drilling equipment manufacturers and vendors. Probability distributions of the key variables were examined to find statistically significant correlations between them. Lastly, the previously determined probability distributions of individual cost components and the correlations between them were input into WellCost Lite, a predictive geothermal drilling cost model, using the Monte Carlo method. This approach allowed us to generate the overall well cost probability distributions for 8000–15,000 ft. (2400–4600 m) geothermal wells. We have shown that the median geothermal well cost increases exponentially with depth. Deep wells typically have higher cost uncertainty and more positively-skewed cost probability distributions. The correlations presented in this paper can be used to determine the economic feasibility of geothermal energy systems, assess the project risk, and facilitate investment decisions.},

	title = {Practical evaluation of borehole heat
exchanger models in {TRNSYS}},
	abstract = {Vertical ground source heat pumps are established and still growing on the global market. The modelling of
these systems is important for system design and optimization. This is an active field of research, and many
models are often built into system simulation software such as TRNSYS. With the intention of having a
better sensibility for existing TRNSYS tools, three different cases are simulated with several TRNSYS tools,
so called Types. A Thermal Response Test, a large borehole field of an IKEA building complex in Sweden,
as well as the Marine Corps Logistic Base in Albany, USA. The vertical ground heat exchanger types 203,
244, 243, 246, 451, 55a and 557b are used. Most of the simulations are investigated and evaluated by
comparing them to measured data. The result shows that, for these specific cases, the DTS types 557a and
557b can underestimate the heat transfer early on due to a poor consideration of the thermal capacity inside
the borehole. Depending on how the thermal resistance is calculated by a module, the fluid mean
temperature simulation is affected by a constant throughout the simulation time. The simulation results
indicate that the type 557b, where the borehole resistance is pre-set as an input and known from
experimental data, is the most accurate of the types for groundwater filled boreholes. On short term, type
451 provides a good coherence with the measured data, with a relative deviation of 10.3 \%. The borehole
models that consider the borehole thermal capacity overestimate the short term heat transfer rate, whereas
those that neglect the borehole capacity underestimate the short term thermal heat transfer on short term.
Existing Types describe successfully the long term behaviour of large borehole fields. Serial versus parallel
coupled BHE fields show relatively small differences in performance when simulated with type 557b for a
specific study case.},

Questions remain regarding the dynamic response and practicality of injection of large amounts of CO2 into shale gas wells. A two-component (CO2 and CH4) model of gas flow in a shale gas formation including adsorption effects provides the basis to investigate the dynamics of CO2 injection. History-matching of gas production data allows for formation parameter estimation. Application to three shale gas-producing regions shows that CO2 can only be injected at low rates into individual wells and that individual well capacity is relatively small, despite significant capacity variation between shale plays. The estimated total capacity of an average Marcellus Shale well in Pennsylvania is 0.5 million metric tonnes (Mt) of CO2, compared with 0.15 Mt in an average Barnett Shale well. Applying the individual well estimates to the total number of existing and permitted planned wells (as of March, 2015) in each play yields a current estimated capacity of 7200–9600 Mt in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and 2100–3100 Mt in the Barnett Shale.},

	abstract = {Abandoned oil and gas wells provide a potential pathway for subsurface migration and emissions of methane and other fluids to the atmosphere. Little is known about methane fluxes from the millions of abandoned wells that exist in the United States. Here, we report direct measurements of methane fluxes from abandoned oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania, using static flux chambers. A total of 42 and 52 direct measurements were made at wells and at locations near the wells (“controls”) in forested, wetland, grassland, and river areas in July, August, October 2013 and January 2014, respectively. The mean methane flow rates at these well locations were 0.27 kg/d/well, and the mean methane flow rate at the control locations was 4.5 × 10−6 kg/d/location. Three out of the 19 measured wells were high emitters that had methane flow rates that were three orders of magnitude larger than the median flow rate of 1.3 × 10−3 kg/d/well. Assuming the mean flow rate found here is representative of all abandoned wells in Pennsylvania, we scaled the methane emissions to be 4–7\% of estimated total anthropogenic methane emissions in Pennsylvania. The presence of ethane, propane, and n-butane, along with the methane isotopic composition, indicate that the emitted methane is predominantly of thermogenic origin. These measurements show that methane emissions from abandoned oil and gas wells can be significant. The research required to quantify these emissions nationally should be undertaken so they can be accurately described and included in greenhouse gas emissions inventories.},

The heat in the water is derived from the normal heat of the rocks and the contribution from chemical heating is negligible. Water is pumped from the mines to act as the primary input to heat pumps for heating and cooling industrial buildings. Annual heat exchange with the mine by the largest user puts more heat into the mine in summer than is taken out in winter. Buildings without heavy machinery, such as office buildings, drain little heat from the mine, so that many heat exchange systems could operate indefinitely, without significant depletion of the heat source. Initial costs of heat pump installation are higher than the costs of conventional oil furnaces, but the operating costs are substantially lower. In the Springhill systems, heat pumps provide summer cooling as well as winter heating and total costs of geotherrnal heating are substantially lower than heating by fuel oil in eastern Canada. There is a net saving in the emission of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.},

In this work, a more comprehensive numerical model has been employed to evaluate the available amount of shallow geothermal energy by using Borehole Heat Exchanger coupled Ground Source Heat Pump systems. Numerical experiments have been performed by simulating the long-term evolution of the subsurface temperature field, which is subject to the operation of borehole heat exchangers and varying parameters like subsurface thermal conductivity and groundwater flow velocity. The concept of equivalent temperature drop is proposed as an auxiliary quantity for the subsurface. With the help of this parameter, a procedure has been established to quantify the amount of shallow geothermal potential. Following this approach, a realistic equivalent temperature reduction is found to be from −1.8 to −4.4°C in the subsurface over a period of 30years. This can be translated to an annual extractable geothermal energy value in a unit surface area, and it ranges from 3.5 to 8.6kWhm−2a−1. The exact value is site specific and heavily depends on the soil thermal conductivity, groundwater velocity, and borehole arrangement.},

Different methods can be used for determining the DD values, depending on the available climatic data of each location. In the present paper, the simplified methods based on reduced climatic data set have been compared assuming the mean daily degree-hours method (MDDH) as reference. Hourly temperature profiles recorded by the meteorological station located at the University of Genoa have been used for these analyses. In the second part of the present work, the ASHRAE method has been selected to calculate heating (HDD) and cooling (CDD) degree days for several Italian cities. In particular, daily meteorological data of several Italian cities (covering the whole climatic conditions which occur in Italy) have been used to calculate heating and cooling degree days in the period 1978–2013, in order to analyze their trends in the last years. Finally, the historical profiles of Rome and Milan have been treated as time-series and analyzed in the frequency domain, performing a decomposition of the original data set into different characterizing components. This simplified approach permits to deeply analyze the historical profile of DD and represents a simple starting point method for future analyses with forecasting perspectives.},

In this paper, we propose a new methodology to assess the energy demands for space heating in buildings at city scale: a degree-day method is applied, coupled with the use of a dynamic urban meteorological model that computes a building energy budget. First, it is shown that the total building space heating energy demand at city scale, as simulated by the meteorological model, is quasi- linearly dependent on the daily mean city scale air temperature. The developed city-scale degree-day method applied to assess the space heating energy demands in Strasbourg Eurometropolis (France) is shown to be consistent with the estimates issued by local official energy sources. A sensitivity analysis highlights the fact that while the heating energy demands are dependent on the building insulation performance and thermostat heating temperatures, scenarios in which building energy properties are changed do not significantly affect the UHI.},

E.g., the average relative heat loss in Denmark is about 20\% and in Sweden only 9\%. Does this mean that the Swedish network insulation is 2 times better?

These cycles were designed to use the geothermal outlet of the Sabalan flash cycle as a heat source. Evaluations were made for the proposed systems to determine the effects of important operating parameters such as turbine inlet pressure, condenser temperature, pinch point temperature and mass flow rate of geofluid on energy and exergy efficiencies, as well as total production cost. Moreover, objective functions of this parametric study were to maximize energy and exergy efficiency levels and to minimize the total production cost. Optimal values of operating parameters were determined by EES optimization using the “variable metric” searching method and defining bounds for each variable as constraints. Among cycles, the maximum energy and exergy efficiency of 20.57\% and 63.72\% were calculated in the IHE-ORC. The obtained results from the cost optimization, revealed that the lowest energy production cost and the lowest total energy cost were calculated to be related to the R-ORC (25.1 \$/GJ) and B-ORC (2.47 M\$/year), respectively. The main aim of this study was to use of Fuzzy TOPSIS as Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique to rank cycles based on problem criteria of thermodynamic and economic performance. These criteria include: energy efficiency (N1), exergy efficiency (N2), net power output (N3), production cost (N4) and total cost rate (N5). The method of Interval Shannon's Entropy was used to determine weight values of the criteria automatically. Thus multi-criteria analysis showed that the IHE-ORC was the best system in Sabalan. Additionally, the Basic, Regenerative and Dual fluid ORC were ranked second, third and fourth respectively.},

Although schemes are commonplace in some countries, in ‘learning countries’ where building-level technologies make up the majority of heating systems there are numerous barriers to introducing DH. Local governments are seen as key actors in helping to create a ‘shared vision’ for DH amongst stakeholders. This study uses interviews with stakeholders from a range of sectors in the UK (an example of a learning country) to examine the visions of local actors for developing DH and the types of national policy that would support local implementation of these visions. The analysis shows that in engaging with DH development local governments seek multiple types of value. Realising this value will most likely happen by taking a long-term, planned approach to development. In contrast, national government policy is geared towards techno-economic criteria and may lead to only a minority of potential sites being developed, without realisation of wider social or environmental benefits aligned to local visions. The work highlights the importance of local strategic planning, enabled by aligned national policy, in realising the full economic, environmental and social benefits of DH.},

	abstract = {Despite millions of dollars in exploration and drilling, and the identification of literally hundreds of high potential resource areas, few new geothermal district energy systems have been built in the United States over the past 25 years. A recent survey, looking into what was hindering such development, concluded that the development of new geothermal district energy systems was not going forward due to a lack of resource information and, in particular, a lack of exploration dollars to support confirmation drilling. But is this really the only or even the most critical need? It is the authors' contention that a lack of knowledge relating to the potential for revenue generation is as much or possibly even more of a problem than the lack of funds to carry out confirmation drilling. What is really needed is a balanced approach to "exploration," one that puts equal emphasis on determining revenue generation potential and resource development potential. And, in fact, a clear determination that revenue generation potential can support development and operation costs should be made prior to the substantial investment that must be made in most cases to confirm the existence of a viable geothermal reservoir. Such a determination would be a prerequisite for private investment, and should be a prerequisite for government support. How such a program should be structured and implemented is covered in detail.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope (δD and δ18O) signatures of three principal groundwater recharge areas in the 21,000-km2 upper Klamath Basin are used to infer recharge sources for aquifers in the interior parts of the basin. Two of the principal recharge areas, the Cascade Range on the western and southern margin of the basin and uplands along the eastern margin, are defined by mean annual precipitation that exceeds approximately 60cm. A third recharge area coincides with the extensive irrigation canal system in the south central part of the basin. The stable isotope signature for Cascade Range groundwater falls near the global meteoric water line (GMWL). The stable isotope signature for the groundwater of the eastern basin uplands also falls near the GMWL, but is depleted in heavy isotopes relative to the Cascade Range groundwater. The stable isotope signature for water from the irrigation canal system deviates from the GMWL in a manner indicative of fractionation by evaporation. Groundwater provenance was previously unknown for two aquifers of interest: that supplying deep (225–792m), large-capacity irrigation wells along the Oregon–California border, and that of the geothermal system near Klamath Falls. Groundwater produced by the deep irrigation wells along the Oregon–California border appears to be a mixture of eastern-basin groundwater and water with an evaporative isotopic signature. The component with an evaporative isotopic signature appears in some places to consist of infiltrated irrigation water. Chloride data suggest that much of the component with the evaporative isotopic signature may be coming from an adjacent subbasin. After accounting for the 18O shift common in geothermal waters, isotope data suggest that the geothermal groundwater in the upper Klamath Basin may emanate from the eastern basin uplands. Findings demonstrate that stable isotope and chloride data can illuminate certain details of a regional groundwater flow system in a complex geologic setting where other hydrologic data are ambiguous.},

Given that most of this demand is met by burning natural gas, propane, and fuel oil, an enormous opportunity exists for directly utilizing indigenous geothermal energy as a cleaner, nearly emissions-free renewable alternative. Although the US is rich in geothermal energy resources, they have been frequently undervalued in America's portfolio of options as a means of offsetting fossil fuel emissions while providing a local, reliable energy source for communities. Currently, there are only 21 operating GDHS in the US with a capacity of about 100MW thermal. Interviews with current US district heating operators were used to collect data on and analyze the development of these systems. This article presents the current structure of the US regulatory and market environment for GDHS along with a comparative study of district heating in Iceland where geothermal energy is extensively utilized. It goes on to review the barriers and enablers to utilizing geothermal district heating systems (GDHS) in the US for space and hot water heating and provides policy recommendations on how to advance this energy sector in the US.},

The use of renewable energy resources and the creation of more efficient energy systems make great contributions to the prevention of greenhouse gases. Recently, many studies indicate that the energy conversion systems have many advantages in terms of technical and economic point of view. In near future, environmental impact is going to play an important role in the selection/design of such energy resources and systems. In this study, the Afyon GDHS (geothermal district heating system) having actual operating conditions is investigated at the component level in terms of environmental impact by using exergoenvironmental analysis. Moreover, the effects of ambient and wellhead temperatures on the environmental impacts of the system are discussed. The results show that a great part of total environmental impact of the system occurs from the exergy destructions of the components. Therefore, the environmental impacts can be reduced by improving their exergetic efficiencies instead of design changes of the system components. The environmental impacts of the system are reduced when the ambient temperature decreases and the wellhead temperature increases. Thus, it might not be necessary to conduct separately the exergoenvironmental analysis for different ambient temperatures.},

All six geothermal heating plants operating in Poland are analyzed including the oldest plant established in 1994 and the newest plant established in 2013. The cost structure of geothermal heating plants tends to significantly; however, amortization is the principal operating cost at close to 55\% in some cases. Other key costs include use of materials and energy. A comparison of the net price of 1GJ of heat produced by selected heating plants shows that heat produced by brown coal (lignite) plants is the least expensive, while that produced by black coal (anthracite) plants is more expensive. The prices of heat produced by geothermal heating plants are less competitive, but still more competitive than those of heat produced using natural gas, biomass, and fuel oil. An analysis of the economic efficiency of geothermal heating plants shows that this source of heat has significant potential for profitability, which is also shown by its positive EBITDA. A notable part of the revenue of geothermal heat companies comes from various types of subsidies and grants. A large number of difficulties of estimate risks and high start-up costs along with a low rate of return have thus far discouraged private entrepreneurs from pursuing this line of investment. As a result, virtually every geothermal heating plant in Poland is owned by the government at the local or national level.},

The BDNG is the core of the Geothopica web site, whose webGIS tool allows different types of user to access geothermal data, to visualize multiple types of datasets, and to perform integrated analyses. The webGIS tool has been recently improved by two specially designed, programmed and implemented visualization tools to display data on well lithology and underground temperatures. This paper describes the contents of the database and its software and data update, as well as the webGIS tool including the new tools for data lithology and temperature visualization. The geoinformation organized in the database and accessible through Geothopica is of use not only for geothermal purposes, but also for any kind of georesource and CO2 storage project requiring the organization of, and access to, deep underground data.

The review structure considers the market, technical, supply, environmental, institutional, and future contexts. The main global conclusions are low utilisation of district heating in buildings, varying implementation rates with respect to countries, moderate commitment to the fundamental idea of district heating, low recognition of possible carbon dioxide emission reductions, and low awareness in general of the district heating and cooling benefits. The cold deliveries from district cooling systems are much smaller than heat deliveries from district heating systems. The European situation can be characterised by higher commitment to the fundamental idea of district heating, lower specific carbon dioxide emissions, and higher awareness of the district heating and cooling benefits. The conclusions obtained from the six contexts analysed show that district heating and cooling systems have strong potentials to be viable heat and cold supply options in a future world. However, more efforts are required for identification, assessment, and implementation of these potentials in order to harvest the global benefits with district heating and cooling.},

Spain has a need to reduce energy consumption in buildings and in the secondary sector in order to comply with the Spanish Energy Plan 2011–2020, which establishes an objective of 50MWe of electricity generation from geothermal energy and 66MWt for direct heating use. Geothermal pumps are admissible in low and medium temperature heating schemes, but to achieve these energy savings targets, the most interesting way to generate energy is by using a CHP production from binary cycle plants. An analysis determining the energy consumption for Spanish dwellings shows that with a low-temperature design concept for district heating distribution, an organic Rankine cycle plant of 15MWt with a geothermal temperature supply of 105°C and a vector transportation fluid mass of 100kg/s can cover 3\% of the expected targets of electricity from geothermal sources and 15\% of that expected for direct heating.},

The purpose of this work is to identify promising areas for the development of this type of renewable energy. The estimation was based on comparison of soil thermal properties and hydrogeological parameters, using Geographic Information System (GIS). To determine the geothermal potential, Ground Source Heat Exchanger (GSHE) coupled with heat pump was used to supply a fixed demand equivalent to the energy required to heat a Chilean standard house. The main barrier for the implementation of a GSHE coupled with heat pump is the well drilling cost, therefore the potential is presented as meters to be drilled in order to install 2 types of GSHE: 1) Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE) and 2) Groundwater Heat Exchanger (GWHE). To assess the BHE, we used specific Heat Extraction (sHE) of sediments. To evaluate a GWHE, we used depth of groundwater table and groundwater drawdown caused by pumping water to the heat pump. The depth to be drilled ranges from 35 to 105 m in case of the BHE, while in case of the GWHE it ranges from 10 to 400 m.},

Radon activity is generally rather low, in most cases less than 5 Bq/L. Only 12 samples had a measured radon activity higher than 5 Bq/L, with a maximum activity of 10.8 Bq/L. The hot water samples generally have a higher radon activity than cold water samples, but samples from boiling borholes have a lower radon activity as radon fractionates into the vapour phase. The geographical distribution of the samples indicates that radon activity is generally lower within the active rift zones. This is most likely due to the very low uranium content of the tholeiites typically erupted within the rift zones. Higher radon values ({\textgreater} 5 Bq/L) are in most cases close to extinct central volcanoes and thus it seems plausible that the water sampled has been in contact with felsic rocks.},

	abstract = {The building sector is responsible for more than one third of the final energy consumption of societies and produces the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions of all sectors. This is due to the utilisation of combustion processes of mainly fossil fuels to satisfy the heating demand of the building stock. Low temperature district heating (LTDH) can contribute significantly to a more efficient use of energy resources as well as better integration of renewable energy (e.g. geothermal or solar heat), and surplus heat (e.g. industrial waste heat) into the heating sector. LTDH offers prospects for both the demand side (community building structure) and the supply side (network properties or energy sources). Especially in connection with buildings that demand only low temperatures for space heating. The utilisation of lower temperatures reduces losses in pipelines and can increase the overall efficiency of the total energy chains used in district heating. To optimise the exergy efficiency of community supply systems the LowEx approach can be utilised, which entails matching the quality levels of energy supply and demand in order to optimise the utilisation of high-value resources, such as combustible fuels, and minimising energy losses and irreversible dissipation. The paper presents the international co-operative work in the framework of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Technology Cooperation Programme on District Heating and Cooling including Combined Heat and Power (DHC{\textbar}CHP) Annex TS1.},

	abstract = {The use of renewable energies in Spain is growing; nevertheless, up to now, a very low use of geothermal energy is found. In this paper, the use of low enthalpy geothermal energy that consists of converting mine galleries in underground heat exchangers is described and analysed. The system would be used in those areas with mining works that with a near future closure, such as Asturias but also other regions of Spain or Europe. The described system, unlike other proposed ones, implies to act before the closure of the mines, when it is possible to access underground galleries. A prediction method for evaluating the system capabilities has been developed which has been calibrated with measurements taken in underground mines and which can be used and calibrated in any mine in operation. Finally, using the method, the capabilities of a typical system are analysed and its viavility from a technical, economic and environmental point of view is proved.},
