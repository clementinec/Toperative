The first and foremost simplification that we observe in the existing models of thermal comfort is how a group of occupants became a single occupant, or a synthetical one for that matter.

Fanger's research back in the 1970s were among the first to suggest that occupants can be represented by a single hypothetical occupant\cite{fanger_thermal_1970}. Based on his own deterministic thermoregulation-based model that calculates the absolute state of thermal comfort devleoped in 1967\cite{fanger_calculation_1967}, his dissertation asserts a calculated PMV within the range of -0.5 and +0.5 is sufficient to be representative of the entire population of any occupant group. Using experimental results collected from 1,394 college students, Fanger concluded that demographic variations among the occupants are not significant enough to affect the thermal comfort conditions. Although there are many further research suggesting otherwise\cite{kingma_energy_2015,wang_individual_2018}, the simplification of the occupants into a single occupant gradually became mainstream\cite{ansi/ashrae_standard_2017}.

\subsubsection{Inputs for individual occupants that haven't been modelled and or guaged}
	The first and perhaps the largest simplification among occupants is the metabolic rate. Following Fanger's proposition in 1967 \cite{fanger_calculation_1967}, the metabolic rate of the occupants has been assumed to be 58.2$W/m^2$, or 1 MET in most of the follow-up literatures and regulations, such as the ASHRAE Standard 55\cite{ashrae_ansi/ashrae_2013} and ISO 7730\cite{iso_iso_2005}. 
        Metabolic rate, clothing factor, age, build and sex are all ignored in conventional comfort modelling, where a middle-aged, medium-built hypothetical man is considered.
